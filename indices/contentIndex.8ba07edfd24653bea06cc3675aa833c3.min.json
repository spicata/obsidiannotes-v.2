{"/":{"title":"Ed's Obsidian Notes","content":"\n# Hello!\n\t\n\n\u003e ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯ maybe this works maybe it doesnt, but christian choe based\n\nWelcome to my website! This is essentially **Obsidian Publish on steroids**, i.e. *this is where I publish my obsidian notes*. \n\nThe website runs using **github pages** and **quartz**, with special thanks to Jacky Zhao [(here is the github page)](https://github.com/jackyzha0), who essentially wrote all the code, did all the hard work, while I've just stolen it. :)\n\nAnyways, as I said the point of this website is to make education free and accessible, as it should be. I will be uploading my generic class notes here, alongside some more refined subject-specific notes, such as methods, spec and chem.\n\n\u003ePlease note that methods and specialist notes will probably be very bad, as you really should be making notes on these subjects yourself. However, the chemistry notes will be of moderate quality, and will be good to read in your spare time if you aren't exactly learning the topics in class.\n\n**All current notes are available at [notes](notes.md)** \n\nYou may also wish to peruse through some sister-sites of this website, which I wholly recommend you do. Especially *\"spicata\"*'s one. You'll find them all [here](https://notes-coalition.github.io/).\n\nI recommend looking through the [topic notes](11AECHE%20Topic%20Notes.md) above all, as most of the [class notes](11AECHE%20Class%20Notes.md) are unformatted, and the [published notes](11AECHE%20Published%20Notes.md) is looking quite barren. Please note however, I am yet to fully transition to a topic-style system when writing notes, so most of the topic notes have nothing in them. Do check out [Electron Configuration](Electron%20Configuration.md), I think its the only one with stuff.\n\nAlso, here's my current [Class note-taking procedure](Class%20note-taking%20procedure.md). (I realise you don't actually have my vault yet, so this won't make sense to you. Its coming soon, trust me)\n\nYou may also enjoy perusing my [Yr11 Chemistry textbook review](Chemistry%20Resources%20review.md).\n\n#### IMPORTANT!\n\nThis website is in the development stage. There will definitely be some unformatted pages, and the whole thing is rather experimental. Check out the development status [here](Development%20Status.md)!\n\nThanks for reading! I hope this website is somewhat useful to you.\n\n**REMEMBER!** [about](about.md), [Development Status](Development%20Status.md)\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/002_PersonalNotes/002a_DailyNotes/2022-05-10":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2022-05-10’s

This is seen in all common computers. A simpler way of visualising this is as below:\n\t\t- **Input -\u003e Computer/Processing -\u003e Output**\n\t\t\t- ***What is an 'Input'?***\n\t\t\t\t- An input is a device/piece of hardware that gets information of some kind. \n\t\t\t\t- *Examples of Input Devices:*\n\t\t\t\t\t- scanners\n\t\t\t\t\t- keyboard\n\t\t\t\t\t- mouse\n\t\t\t\t\t- touch-screen\n\t\t\t\t\t- sensors\n\t\t\t\t\t- etc.\n\t\t\t\t- This forms a vital part of computers, as this allows for information such as keystrokes from a keyboard, and the position of a mouse to be calculated, therefore allowing for a more user-friendly user experience\n\t\t\t- ***What is an 'Output'?***\n\t\t\t\t- An output is a device/piece of hardware that gets the processed information, and displays them in some form to be accessible to an end-user. \n\t\t\t\t- *Examples of Output Devices:*\n\t\t\t\t\t- Monitor\n\t\t\t\t\t- Printer\n\t\t\t\t\t- Speakers\n\t\t\t\t\t- etc.\n\t\t\t\t- This is also a fundamental part of computers, as this provides feedback for the end user as to what they are doing. This is generally visual, although can appeal to other senses (such as through the use of Audio). \n\t\t\t- ***What is 'Processing'?***\n\t\t\t\t- Processing involves the manipulation of data to produce a different result. This can be as simple as counting up/down, or keeping the time, but through more complex calculations, can do things such as physics calculations.\n\t\t\t\t- **Components of 'Processing' (2)**:\n\t\t\t\t\t- CPU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- *Central Processing Unit*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- This is the main form of processing in most computers, and has a chip that has many tiny silicon transistors\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- *Parts of a CPU:*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **CPU Busses (3):**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Address Bus**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This holds information for all the addresses (i.e. where all the data is located, especially for RAM)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Data Bus**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This bus has access to all the data in a computer, and is able to read/write to hardware\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Control Bus**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This bus controls all the other busses, and includes the Control Unit (CU), which generates instructions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **CPU Components (5 Units)**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Control Unit (CU)**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This controls all the data transfer and instructions for the CPU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Manages all the other units\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Gets instructions from memory, and directs the operation of the computer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Communicates with input/output devices to transfer data from storage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **DOES NOT** process or store data\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Does the actual processing of data\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Registers**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Memory Device (Information from the ALU goes to a Register)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **System Clock**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Keeps track of operations, and keeps operations in sync (the clock speed in a CPU)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Program Counter**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Counts the tasks being done (+1 per process), and notes what the next instructions are, and what data has been processed and schedules the next operation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **CPU Fetch Cycle (4)**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Fetch Data**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Done by the Control Unit**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Fetches data from memory\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Decode**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Done by the Control Unit**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Translates information into machine code\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Process**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Done by the Arithmetic Logic Unit**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Does the actual processing of information\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Store**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Done by the Registers, and it stores information into Primary and Secondary Storage.\n\t\t\t\t\t- ***Memory***\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Primary Memory**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Primary Memory consists of '*Volatile*' memory (think about it as things that are generally flushed after shutting down a computer). As these are usually deleted very often, it doesn't hold any vital long term information, and generally holds temporary information (such as application details, and cache)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- *Examples of 'Primary Memory' are:*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **RAM**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- *Random Access Memory*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Not directly connected to the CPU**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Note that this is the only example of Primary Memory that is not directly connected to the CPU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This is the most commonly recognisable form of primary memory, and is generally the largest capacity of Primary Memory in a system. This holds working information from the CPU (such as instructions), application details and cache\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Cache**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Directly connected to the CPU**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This generally holds instructions for the CPU, especially if it is likely to reuse them. This is generally very small (in modern data standards), as it only holds information in hexadecimal or binary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Registers**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Directly connected to CPU**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This holds information about the information (such as what address information is held), and other temporary information that is vital to CPU instructions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Advantages/Disadvantages of Primary Memory**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Very Quick**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This is vital, as CPUs have gotten good enough where the Primary Memory is often a bottle-neck. Due to this, this memory has to be extremely quick in order to allow for the CPU to go to it's full potential. This also means that it is generally flash memory, as it is extremely quick, and also doesn't require any extra moving parts (and reducing points of failure is important for a CPU, which doesn't have any moving parts at all)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Very Small (in Capacity)**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This is a downside of Primary Memory, as it is so expensive, it is difficult to get large amounts of it. It is also not designed to hold a lot of information, as it only needs to hold hexadecimal values or binary. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Secondary Memory**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Secondary Memory consists of more '*Permanent*' memory (i.e. things that persist after shutting a computer down). This is what more important things are generally stored (such as documents, and user files), as otherwise they would be flushed every time someone were to shut down their computer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- *Examples of 'Secondary Memory' are:*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **SSD**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- *Solid State Drive*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This is a storage device that uses '*flash-storage*' (i.e. something that holds electricity to represent a bit), and is generally very quick, and the downside of being more expensive per gigabyte. SSDs have no moving parts, and therefore are very reliable\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **HDD**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- *Hard Drive Disk*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This is a storage device that uses physical 'platters', that are written into via a laser to produce bumps, which can then be read as a binary '0' or '1'. This allows for permanent storage, and is significantly cheaper than SSDs to manufacture, and have a higher gigabyte/dollar value, at the cost of being significantly slower than an SSD.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Advantages/Disadvantages of Secondary Memory**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Needs an Extra Controller:**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Secondary Memory needs an extra controller to access (i.e. the CPU cannot directly access it). It needs something such as an *'NVMe'* Controller or *'SATA'* Controller to access.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Easier to package:**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- It is connected to the Motherboard, and therefore can be much more spread out (with things such as cables allowing for much freer designs and applications)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Much cheaper than Primary Memory**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- It is significantly cheaper than Primary Memory to produce, and also has the option to be much larger than Primary Memory\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Much slower than Primary Memory**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- As it isn't as vital for this memory to be quick, it is generally slower to have the potential of fitting in more information in for the money\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- **Much more storage compared to Primary Memory**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Secondary Memory can hold much more memory compared to Primary Memory as it is designed to hold different forms of information such as documents, and the Operating System, which take up a lot of room.\n\n### Software:\n- ***What are the different types of software?***\n\t- **Operating System**\n\t\t- This is a piece of Software which is the main interface that a user will interface with, and also the main framework for applications to be run\n\t\t- **Types of Operating Systems**\n\t\t\t- **Desktop Operating Systems**\n\t\t\t\t- Standard consumer operating systems (such as Windows, MacOS and GNU/Linux)\n\t\t\t- **Server Operating Systems**\n\t\t\t\t- Server operating systems (such as RedHat, CentOS, Microsoft Server OS)\n\t\t\t- **Embedded/Realtime

etc.\n\t- **Utility Software**\n\t\t- Controls actual hardware, and allows for it to run smoothly\n\t\t- **Examples of Utility Software:**\n\t\t\t- Anti-virus software\n\t\t\t- UEFI/BIOS\n\t\t\t- Clean-Disk Software\n\t\t\t- Drivers\n\t\t\t- Firmware\n\t\t\t- etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Databases\nThis will have all my notes for Databases\n\n### Databases Notes\n- **What are the components of a Database?**\n\t- **Table**\n\t- Where actual data is stored\n\t- ***FEILD***s represent entire columns of data\n\t- ***RECORD***s represent entire rows of data\n\t- This is a literal table (similar to

High electrical/thermal conductivity\n\t5. High malleability\n\t6. High ductility\n\n18. They have these properties because....\n\t1. There is an extremely strong force of attraction between metal cations and the sea of delocalised electrons. This means that more energy is needed to separate metallic ions. As by definition, the melting point is the temperature where particles that are very close to each are separated to the point where they are considered liquid, the melting point of metals are very high.\n\t2. Similarly to melting point, more energy is required to separate the atoms of metals, as the strong electrostatic force of attraction between ions and their sea of delocalised electrons keeps atoms together. Thus, the boiling point of metals are very high.\n\t3. There is a strong electrostatic force of attraction between metal cations and their sea of delocalised electrons. This pulls metal cations closer together, meaning there is a higher concentration of atoms within a set volume of a metal. Thus, metals are highly dense.\n\t4. In metallic bonding, electrons are mobile as they move around in a sea of delocalised electrons. This means that electrons easily move around in metals, making them good electrical/thermal conductors.\n\t5. The attractive force between the sea of delocalised electrons and metal cations is non-direction. Thus, when pressure is applied metal cations slide across within their sea of delocalised electrons. This makes metals malleable as they can easily be bent without the structure changing.\n\t6. There is no rigid structure or lattice within metallic bonding. This means that metals can be stretched into a linear shape, as thin as a single cation. This works as long as the cations are surrounded by a sea of delocalised electrons. Thus, metals are highly ductile","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.539775223Z","tags":null},"/1.3-Writing-Chemical-Equations-Worksheet":{"title":"","content":"# Writing Chemical Equations, Moles to Moles, Mass to Moles, Moles to Mass and Mass to Mass Equations\n\nIonic Compounds\n1. $NaF$, 41.99\n2. $KCl$, 74.55\n3. $MgBr_2$, 184.11\n4. $Na_2O$, 61.98\n5. $AlCl_3$, 133.33\n6. $Al_2O_3$, 101.96\n7. $Mg(NO_3)_2$, 148.33\n8. $(NH_4)_2SO_4$, 132.154\n9. $Al_2(SO_4)_3$, 342.174\n10. $Ba(OH)_2$, 171.346\n11. $(NH_4)_2CO_3$, 96.094\n\nCovalent Compounds\n1. $CO_2$, 44.01\n2. $SO_3$, 80.07\n3. $CCl_4$, 153.81\n4. $N_2O_2$, 60.02\n5. $H_2SO_4$, 98.086\n6. $CH_4$, 16.042\n7. $NH_3$, 17.034\n8. $N_2O_4$, 92.02\n9. $HCl$, 36.458\n10. $HNO_3$, 63.018\n11. $PCl_5$, 208.224\n\nBalancing Equations\n1. $C_{(s)} + O_{2(g)} \\rightarrow CO_{2(g)} \\checkmark$\n2. $2C_{(s)} + O_{2(g)} \\rightarrow 2CO_{(g)}$\n3. $Zn_{(s)} + 2HCl_{(aq)} \\rightarrow ZnCl_{2(aq)} + H_{2(g)}$\n4. $4Na_{(s)}+O_{2(g)}\\rightarrow 2Na_2O_{(s)}$\n5. $CH_{4(g)} + 2O_{2(g)} \\rightarrow CO_{2(g)} + 2H_2O_{(l)}$\n6. $2HNO_{3(aq)} + (NH_4)_2CO_{3(aq)} \\rightarrow 2NH_4NO_{3(aq)} + H_2O_{(l)} + CO_{2(g)}$\n7. $Al_{(s)}+Fe_2O_{3(s)} \\rightarrow Al_2O_{3(s)}+Fe_{(s)} \\checkmark$\n8. $Zn_{(s)} + Pb(NO_3)_{2(aq)} \\rightarrow Zn(NO_3)_{2(aq)}+ Pb_{(s)} \\checkmark$\n9. $2AlBr_{3(aq)} + 3Cl_{2(g)} \\rightarrow 2AlCl_{3(aq)} + 3Br_{2(g)}$\n10. $2Na_3PO_{4(aq)} + 3CaCl_{2(aq)} \\rightarrow Ca_3(PO_4)_{2(s)} + 6NaCl_{(aq)}$\n11. $2K_{(S)} + Cl_{2(g)}\\rightarrow 2KCl_{(aq)}$\n12. $2Al_{(s)} + 6HCl_{(aq)} \\rightarrow 2AlCl_{3(aq)} + 3H_{2(g)}$\n13. $3Ca(OH)_{2(s)} + 2H_3PO_{4(aq)}\\rightarrow Ca_3(PO_4)_{2(s)} + 6H_2O_{(l)}$\n14. $Cu_{(s)} + 2H_2SO_{4(aq)} \\rightarrow CUSo_{4(aq)} + 2H_2O_{(l)} + SO_{2(g)}$\n15. $2H_{2(g)} + 2NO_{(g)} \\rightarrow 2H_2O_{(l)} + N_{2(g)}$\n\nMass/Mass Conversions\nNote: The mass of one mole of a substance is equal to its AMU (Atomic Mass Unit), which is found in the periodic table\n           n = m/M,  m = nM, given one mole, **m = M**\n           \n1. $m(H_{2}O)= 2 \\times 1.008 +16 =18.016g$\n2. $m(Cl_{2}) = 2 \\times 35.45 = 70.49g$\n3. $m(NO_{2})=14.01 + 2 \\times 16 = 46.01g$\n4. $m(NH_{3}) = 14.01 + 3 \\times 1.008 = 17.034g$\n5. $m(CH_3COOH)=2 \\times 12.01 + 4 \\times 1.008 + 2 \\times 16 = 60.052g$\n6. $m(CaCl_2)=40.08 + 2 \\times 35.45 = 110.98g$\n7. $m(CuH_2PO_4) = 63.55 + 2(2 \\times 1.008 + 30.97 + 4 \\times 16) = 257.522g$\n\nNote: **n = m/M, m = nM**\n1. $m(N_2)=2 \\times 2 \\times 14.01 = 56.04g$\n2. $m(Mg(NO_3)_2)= 3.2\\times (24.31 + 2(14.01 + 3 \\times 16)) = 476.656g$\n3. $m(Fe_2O_3)=0.1\\times (2 \\times 55.85 + 3 \\times 16) = 15.97g$\n\nNote: **$n = \\frac{m}{M}$\n1. $=\\frac{81}{26.98}= 3.002 \\ mol$\n2. $=\\frac{5.3}{40.08 + (32.07 + 4 \\times 16)}= 0.0389 \\ mol$\n3. $= \\frac{189}{2(26.98)+3(16)}=1.854 \\ mol$\n\nMore thinking required:\n1.

Potassium has an electronic configuration of $2,8,8,1$, it will achieve stability by losing electrons to have the electron configuration of its nearest noble gas (Argon). \n\nAs you go lower on a group, elements get more reactive.\n\nThis is because attraction to nucleus is lower as the number of shells increase (and the distance from the energy levels and nucleus increases).\n\nTo become an ion you require ionisation energy.\n\nIonisation energy is needed to break the attraction between an electron and its nucleus, so the further away an electron is from its nucleus the weaker the attraction force, and thus less ionisation energy is required to ionise.\n\nThus, elements in higher periods are more reactive.\n\nTherefore, elements in higher periods have lower ionisation energy.\n\n**Non-metals typically gain electrons.**\n\nTypical behaviour of group 7 (non-metals) is to gain electrons.\n\n**Check for diatomic molecules!!**\n\ne.g.\n\n$Cl_{2}+ 2\\bar e \\rightarrow 2Cl^-$\n\nWhat is charge of nitride\n\nNitrogen has an electron configuration of $2,5$.

Realistically, if this were to happen in nature it would involve 2 atoms, as Nitrogen is diatomic.\n\nBecause nitrogen has a smaller atom, and when nitrogen gains electrons, the nucleus's attraction to the electron will be stronger than, for example, phosphorus, as the nucleus' attractive force will be stronger as distance decreases.\n\n**Principle quantum number** is the term for n.\n\n**A new energy level of shell is started at the beginning of each new Period.**\n\n**Period number is the principle quantum number of the shell being filled.**\n\n**Group number is the number of electrons in the outer shell.** (somewhat, not including the transition metals)\n\n\n\n**Subshells - Electronic Configuration:**\n* Electrons are arranged in energy levels or shells\n* Energy of shells increases as distance from nucleus increases.\n* n is the principle quantum number which shows energy\n* The maximum number of each shell is $2n^2$\n\n* Shells are divided into **sub-shells**.\n* n = 1 has a single s subshell\n* n = 2 has s **and** p subshells\n* n = 3 has s, p and d subshells\n* The subshells are:\n\t* **s, p, d, f**\n\n\n* The 's' subshells holds a maximum of 2 electrons.\n* The 'p' subshells holds a maximum of 6 electrons.\n* The 'd' subshells holds a maximum of 10 electrons.\n* The 'f' subshells holds a maximum of 10 electrons\n\nhttps://byjus.com/chemistry/aufbau-principle/\n![[AufbauPrinciple.png]]\n\ne.g. Hydrogen in spdf notation:\n\n$_1H$      $1s^1$\n\nhere, the first 1 is the principle quantum number (energy level).

Thus, when you apply force cations slide around in a sea of delocalised electrons.\n* The structure does not break, as the structure is **rigid**.\n\n**Ductility**:\n* Quality of metals that allows metals to be pulled into wires.\n* When producing a wire, the cations just move into a linear shape, surrounded by the sea of delocalised electrons in a network.\n\n**Ionic Bonding**:\n* If a compound has a metal and a non-metal, it is ionic.\n* Typical behaviour: solid at room temperature.\n\n* Noble gases are chemically stable because they have full outer shells of electrons.\n* s-block elements lose one or more electrons to form stable cations (positively charged ions).\n* There is a transfer of electrons from metal atoms to non-metal atoms to form anions and cations with stable electronic configurations.\n* p-block elements gain one or more electrons to form stable anions (negatively charged ions).\n* There is a transfer of electrons from metal atoms to non-metal atoms to form anions and cations with stable electronic configurations.\n\nyea ms pilling is the kind of teacher to teach an entire chem topic in a single lesson\n\nNote: **Most metals are found on the left side.

However, oxygen has a greater electronegativity than nitrogen, thus the hydrogen bonding between water molecules will be greater than between ammonia molecules, and more energy is required to overcome the stronger intermolecular forces. As energy is proportional to temperature, water will have a higher boiling point.\n\n==Solubility of gasses decreases as temperature increases  (inversely proportional)== \n\n\nSolutions form when the solvent and solute mix. THis process involves breaking the bonds/attraction in these individual substances, which is **endothermic**, so requires energy.\n\nIn the solution, attractions form between the solvent and solute, and this bond formation is **exothermic**, releasing energy.\n\nWhether the solution forms overall depends on  the overall process requires too much energy to be **favourable**.\n\nWe want more energy to be released, then energy to be consumed, for a substance to be dissolved and thus create a solution.\n\n**Water - the universal solvent**\n- As a highly polar molecule, water is great at dissolving polar molecular substances and many ionic substances.\n\n- Water can form a range of intermolecular forces to stabilise an solution:\n\n**Ion-dipole forces:**\n* Ion-dipole forces form between ions of an ionic compound and molecules of water. We say the ions are hydrated.\n- If the ion-dipole forces formed between ions and water are strong enough, they can pull ions off the surface of an ionic lattice, and the ionic substance is soluble.\n- Not all ionic substances dissolve. In insoluble substances, the ionic bonding is too strong, and the ion-dipole bonds formed are not strong enough to beak up the ionic lattice.\n\n**Solubility of ionic substances**\nAll ionic substances are soluble to some extent, so we categorise substances by the concentration of a saturated solution at 25 degrees celcius.\n\n* A substance is soluble if a saturated solution is 0.1 mol L-1 or higher.\n* A substance is described as slightly soluble if a saturated solution is 0.01 mol L-1 to 0.1 mol L-1\n* A substance is described as insoluble if a saturated solution is below 0.01 mol L-1\n\n* In most insoluble substances, the rate of reaction for ions to both be displaced and reform the ionic lattice is equal (without solvent). This leads to an equilibrium. When water is added, the rate of reaction for ions to become displaced increases. However, this increase is marginal. In theory, if you add enough solvent the substance will dissolve.\n\n---\n# Recall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n# Summary\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.539775223Z","tags":null},"/11AECHE-Class-3":{"title":"","content":"# Class 3\n\n\n## Notes\n\nPractical 1 - Homogenous and Heterogenous mixtures\\:\n\nPage 10 STAWA Book\n\nProcedure:\n\n![[Notions Table 1.png]]\nC:\n\nTest the solubility of a small sample (half a teaspoon) of ethanol, charcoal, sodium chloride and copper (II) chloride in separate 15 mL lots of distilled water.

The increase in surface area makes it more likely for the higher-boiling liquid to lose its energy and fall back down as a liquid.\n    -   This increases the purity of the condensed product.\n    -   E.g. if you have 2 liquids with boiling points 65 and 75, and you place it in a fractional distillation apparatus that boils at a temperature of 70, the 65-liquid would be in a temperature that exceeds their boiling points, so they would have a lot of energy (higher temperatures causes gasses to move faster), so they are much more likely to be able to reach the top due to their high kinetic energy. The 75-liquid would not be as highly charged, however a small portion of its particles may become gaseous. However, the increase in surface area creates a large chance that these particles will hit into the surface area, and as they don’t have much energy they will fall back down as a liquid.\n-   Crystallization\n    \n-   Electrostatic attraction\n    \n    -   Repulsion/attraction due to charged particles\n-   Magnetic susceptibility\n    \n    -   Metals reacting with a magnetic field (magnet)\n-   Vaporisation\n    \n    -   If the substance you are looking for decomposes at high temperatures, dont use\n    -   e.g. Ammonium Nitrate\n-   Decanting\n    \n-   Sieving\n    \n\n(D) = need to know how to draw diagram\n\nSeparating Mixtures:\n\n-   Mixtures can be separated by any means that makes use of the different physical properties of its constituents.\n-   The properties of the components of a mixture determine the best separation method\n\n**Homework:**\n\nLucarelli Ch3: Mixtures and Separation , Set 4\n\nPearson Ch 1: Materials in our world - nano-materials?\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Recall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Summary","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.543775327Z","tags":null},"/11AECHE-Class-40":{"title":"","content":"\n# AECHE Class 40\n\nC-C and C-H bonds are considered **non-polar**.\n\nComplete combustion happens when oxygen in excess, this is the **main** form of combustion\n- $CO_2$ is produced\n\nIncomplete combustion occurs in a limited supply of oxygen.\n- $C$ or $CO$ is produced\n\nAlkanes undergo **substitution reactions**.\n\nIn terms of halogens, we only care about $Cl_2,Br_2,I_2$ for organic chemistry, as they have colours in their aqueous form which we can use to identify reactions.\n\n\n\n\n---\n# Recall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n# Summary\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.543775327Z","tags":null},"/11AECHE-Class-41":{"title":"","content":"\n# 11AECHE Class 41\n\nProperties of Alkanes\n- 3-ethylhexane\n- C8H18\n- C4H9\n\nChemical Properties:\n- Combustion, alkanes are commonly used as fuels. \n- Substitution reaction\n\t- $C_2H_6$ + $Br_2$ $\\rightarrow (UV light)$ $C_2H_5Br$ + $HBr$\n\t- In the absence of light, reaction does not occur.\n\t- You need UV light for the reaction to occur.\n\t- Note the name of the produced is bromoethane\n\t- $C_{2}H_{5}Br + Br_{2} \\rightarrow C_2H_{4}Br_{2} + HBr$\n\t- We cannot predict where the second bromine will be located.

Another method is to allow two immiscible liquids to separate and the lighter liquid is poured off.\n-   Sieving\n    -   a porous material is used to separate particles of different sizes.\n    -   method is most commonly used to effect gross separations, as of liquids from suspended crystals or other solids\n    -   to accelerate filtration, pressure usually is applied\n    -   a series of sieves is attached, with the screen of largest hole size at the top.\n-   Flotation\n-   Distillation\n    -   used to separate homogenous mixtures\n    -   based on difference in boiling points of substances involved\n    -   **Be able to draw a distillation apparatus**\n\nSlightly soluble = soluble\n\n-   NaCl and CuCl_2 are both soluble in water, so using water to dissolve one but not the other doesn’t work. However, in Ethanol, as NaCl has a strong ionic bond, ethanol isn’t polar enough (dipole). So NaCl will not dissolve and CuCl_2 will.\n\nNext part:\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n-   **Solution:** A mixture in which the solute particles are homogenously distributed throughout particles of solvent\n    \n    -   Can be solid (e.g. Bronze(Metal alloys)), liquid (e.g. Sea water) or gas (e.g. Air)\n-   **Aqueous Solution:** Liquid solution where the solvent is water\n    \n-   **Solvent:** The major component of a solution by mass\n    \n-   **Solute:** The minor components of a solution by mass\n    \n-   **Dissolving:** Solid particles are separated and distributed throughout the mixture, increasing solution concentration.\n    \n-   **Unsaturated:** Contains less solute than the solvent is normally able to dissolve\n    \n-   **Saturated:** Contain the same amount of solute that the solvent is normally able to dissolve\n    \n    -   Rate of dissolving and crystallization are equal\n-   **Supersaturated:** Contains more solute than the solvent is normally able to dissolve\n    \n    -   Can be achieved through heating and dissolving, then carefully cooling the solution.\n\nSolubility curves.\n\n**Solubility is measured in how many grams of solute dissolves in 100 mL.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Recall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Summary","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.543775327Z","tags":null},"/11AECHE-Class-6":{"title":"","content":"\n# Class 6\n\n\n## Notes\nCrystallisation occurs when the solution solvent evaporates, and the concentration of the solute reaches saturation point.

Most of the volume of the atom is empty space\n\nProtons and neutrons exist in a dense core at the centre of the atom. This is called the **nucleus**. It is held together by the strong nuclear force.\n\nThe electrons are spread out around the edge of the atom. They surround the nucleus in layers called shells or energy levels.\n\nElectron’s relative mass is approximately 1/1840. - negligible\n\nRelative mass is relative to a proton.\n\nZ = atomic number - its on the bottom\n\nA = atomic mass - number of protons + neutrons.\n\nIsotopes:\n\n**Atoms with the same number of protons (element), and a different number of neutrons.**\n\nIsotopic ions\n\nCarbon 12 be like\n\nCarbon 14 is radioactive, used in carbon dating.\n\n$A_r$ = $\\frac{(RIM + PercentageAbundance)+.....}{100}$\n\nRIM = Relative Isotopic Mass\n\n**Classifications of Matter homework:**\n\nQ1:\n\nPure substances:\n\n-   Elements: **cannot be separated**\n    -   Gold, oxygen, aluminium\n-   Compounds: **made of 2 or more elements chemically bonded together**\n    -   Limestone, sugar, water(assuming distilled)\n\nMixtures:\n\n-   Homogenous: **uniform composition throughout**\n    -   Sea-water, cement, solder, rubber, salt, brass, petrol\n-   Heterogenous: **non-uniform composition**\n    -   Rock\n\nQ2:\n\na) A compound is 2 or more elements chemically bonded together, whereas a solution involves a solute dissolving in a solvent, and are not bonded together.\n\nb) No, a solution is a homogenous mixture. The solute and solvent are not chemically bonded together, so they are not a compound, however they are uniform, so it is homogenous. As it is not a pure substance, it must be a mixture.\n\nc) The salt is a compound. As it both released a metal and a gas, this indicates that it is most likely an ionic compound, comprised of a transition metal, and a gas, Chlorine.\n\nQ3:\n\nMatter:\n\nHomogenous:\n\nPure substances:\n\nElements\n\nCompounds\n\nSolutions\n\nHomogenous mixtures\n\nHeterogenous:\n\nHeterogenous mixtures\n\nQ4:\n\nDecanting is a method of separation where gravity is used to separate a solid from a liquid.

American ships are seized, making Japan the strongest naval power in the world. Concentration camps are set up all across the U.S., with thousands of dissidents dying daily till numbers drop a year after the capitulation.\n\n1.  **Second Sino - Japanese War**\n\nDelayed for a year due to invasion of the U.S. but army, backed by nationalized American industry, smashes through China. The Chinese are pushed all the way to Chengdu, where they surrender.\n\nResults:\n\nA Chinese puppet state is set up, while the Japanese take all coastal provinces directly - Under pressure from Japan, Siam joins the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\n1.  **Khalkhin Gaul (Japanese - Soviet Border War)**\n\nJapanese Victory. Elite battle-hardened Japanese infantry demolish under-supplied Soviet troops with incompetent leadership. North Sakhalin is seized by the Japanese\n\n1.  **Manchuria**\n\nManchuria is integrated into the greater Chinese puppet state. The puppet regime, called the \"Reorganised Chinese State\", comprises of smaller provinces, such as Manchuria and Mengjiang. Aisin Gioro Puyi is empowered as a puppet figure, with the actual power coming from the individual leaders of each province, all of them of Japanese origin and endlessly bickering over their power in the region. The capital is Nanjing. The Chinese government is tasked with suppressing Communist and Nationalist insurrections.\n\n1.  **Mengjiang - Mongolian Skirmishes**\n\nFights between the Mongolian Communists and the militias of the province of Mengjiang, under the leadership of Demchugdongrub, Mengjiang claiming they are the natural successors of the Mongol Empire. After a string of losses and heavy casualties, an anti-communist revolt occurs in Ulaanbatar, with the communist government being overthrown before Soviet aid arrives. The provisional government subsequently leaves the Comintern and votes to re-join Mengjiang. Mengjiang is renamed \"Greater Mongolia\".\n\n1.  **The Pacific States of America**\n\nThe Pacific States consists of major cities such as New Vegas, Los Angeles and Sacramento. They are given command of all Japanese naval assets in the Pacific. It is under the leadership of famed naval admiral Yamamoto. The Pacific States rapidly becomes a navally-focused regime, with its minimal army consisting of rookie Japanese conscripts and Japanese collaborators, suppressing the local population.\n\n1.  **The Central States**\n\nThe Central States are industrialized by numerous Japanese economic plans in the region. It is the most supervised Japanese protectorate due to large rebel activity.\n\n1.  **The Atlantic States**\n\nThe last remnants of the United States. Everything from the previous governmental system is transferred other than a Japanese-only senate having the ability to veto and create any laws. Quotas of slave labour are set by the Japanese government, with thousands of Americans sent to the Japanese Mainland.\n\n1.  **American Resistance Movement**\n\nNumerous resistances arise, but the most prominent is the American Revolutionary Organisation (ARO), which are most active in the Central States, due to its large amounts of workers. Their popularity in the Central States is around 50% of the population. They have executed numerous terrorist attacks, such as factory bombings and assassinations. Their growth has been stymied by Japanese public executions of known ARO members.\n\n9.1. **The ARO**\n\nThe ARO is a broad coalition of mainly socialist underground organisations. This includes Trotskyists, Stalinists, democratic socialists, syndicalists and even anarchists. Despite their differences, they are united in their utter hatred for their Japanese overlords and believe revolution is the only way to achieve their deposition. They are currently under the leadership of a coalition between the communists and the syndicalists, their leader being Jack Reed, a newspaper writer turned syndicalist figurehead and the symbol for pro-American revolution.\n\n1.  **The Philippines**\n\nWhen the U.S. fell, they surrendered all sovereignty over the Philippines to the Japanese. After a brief military occupation, a puppet government was set up.\n\n1.  **French Indochina**\n\nFrench Indochina is seized by the Japanese with no resistance.\n\n1.  **The British Raj**\n\nNumerous border wars between the Raj and the Japanese occur throughout world war 2.\n\n1.  **Anglo - Japanese Relations:**\n\nDespite a dip in relations when the British sided with the Americans in the Treaty of Versailles, the British rekindled their friendship with the Japanese and formalise a trade pact between each other, similar to the Molotov - Ribbentrop pact in our universe. This leads to a secret agreement between the two parties, where the British lift their guarantee of the Dutch East Indies. This leads to the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies 3 months later.\n\n1.  **American Government in Exile**\n\nThe former U.S. Government is exiled to Anchorage, in Alaska. It is the last bastion of American democracy.\n\n# British Brainstorm #1\n\n**Ruling Government Ideas:**\n\n1.

This is rejected by Halifax, which results in the complete and utter annihilation of London after the superior Luftwaffe bombers rain down a barrage of explosives onto tired and broken British anti-air men. After which, the British reapproached the Germans and accepted unconditional surrender. The British Parliament is dissolved, as a puppet civilian government named \"Reichskommissariat Britannien\" takes control of the British isles. The majority of British owned Africa, including South Africa, is transferred to the Italians, excluding Egypt and the Middle East.\n\nWith the fall of the Allied Powers, the United States reaffirms their ideals of Isolationism under F.D.R.. Operation Barbarossa is executed as planned, and with even faster speeds, due to the land army being reinforced with the Afrika Korps and their panzers. With the Soviet Union being demoralized by the fall of the U.K., a peace treaty is signed where all territory is ceded to Germany up to the Ural Mountains.\n\n# **Story - Event timeline essentially:**\n\n**Part 1 - Prelude**\n\nWith all their enemies defeated and German hegemony asserted over Europe, the Reichstag is tasked with dividing all the new territories. In the end, the Benelux became a Reichskommissariat, including the German owned territories of France, Ukraine, Ostland (The Baltics) and Russia. Poland becomes an integrated puppet state, named the Generalgouvernement.\n\nAfter a year of the Carving of Europe, Germany executed a large-scale invasion of Scandinavia, conquering Norway, Sweden and Finland in only a month. A new Reichskommissariat is set up, \"Reichskommissariat Skandinavien\". With approval from Hitler, the Spanish State under Franco joined the Axis and invaded Portugal, destroying the Portuguese and annexing the entirety of Portugal. It is forced to rename itself to \"Reichskommissariat Spanien.\"\n\nAt the same time, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria are forced by Germany to unite, with each nationality being given partial autonomy. They banded together to create the nation known as \"Reichskommissariat Balkan\".\n\nMussolini, disappointed by their gains in the end of world war 2, declares the Second Vittoria Mutilata (Mutilated Victory), announcing their ambitions to achieve their own type of lebensraum for all Italian people.\n\nAfter seizing a large portion of Yugoslavia, a military government is set up, named the \"Governo Militare Balcanico\". The Greek people are given partial autonomy, under the civilian government \"Nazione Greca\". Their Africa holdings are separated into 2 Military Governments, the \"Governo Militare Nord-Africano\" and \"Governo Militare Mediorientale\".\n\nAfter Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's death, nationalists in the country seized power in Turkey, in an elitist paramilitary coup. Under the leadership of Alparslan Türkeş, Turkey aligns itself to Italy.\n\nWith the fall of Petain in Vichy France by a military sponsored coup d'état, the remnants of the French Republic distance themselves from the war-mongering Germans and align themselves with Italy.\n\nAfter both France and Turkey declared their support for Italy, they signed a defensive treaty to come to each other's assistance in the event of a German invasion. This treaty is called the Malta Pact, signed within the Italian-Occupied city of Malta.\n\nAfter the Soviet Union is banished into the Siberian winter, parts of the Union starts to fall apart. Around 7 months after the Carving of Europe, Kazakhstan and numerous other countries declare independence simultaneously within a single month's period. This leads to a final wave of disapproval for Stalin's totalitarian police state, with him being removed and his body being hung in Red Square. The Union dissolves after Stalin's death, with 2 Russia's being created after, Red Russia and White Russia, which subsequently fall into a civil war. Siberia is also freed, but no central authority comes into power, leaving Siberia an anarchist wasteland.\n\nHitler, having now won World War 2, lives the rest of his life in relative quiet, as he ages. Factionalism within the Reichstag, which frequently meets in a refurbished Reichstag Building, increases, with conservatives fighting the militarist and liberal factions of the NSDAP.\n\nAs Hitler reaches the age of 76, on the 20th of April, 1965, he suffers a massive stroke, leaving him paralysed for a week. This leaves the German Reich in chaos, which is only solved when a hastily made coalition consisting of most factions of the NSDAP excluding the fanatical SS write a new enabling act in the Reichstag, basically giving them the power to make laws without Hitler's presence, essentially creating a government without a prime minister.\n\nHitler, now on his deathbed, officially rescinds his dictatorial powers to the Reichstag, which dissolves the role of fuhrer as Hitler passes. Hitler dies a month after his stroke.\n\nThe current status of the Reichstag is an uneasy calm. While the coalition, named the Unity-Koalition prevents the largest faction within the Reichstag, the SS Loyalists, from taking control over Germany, neither of the 3 main factions of the coalition can assume power, as if one tries to the other two will disassemble the coalition, sending Germany into chaos.\n\nThe 3 factions of the Unity-Koalition includes the moderate faction, the largest faction of the coalition under the leadership of Martin Bormann, the Militarist wing, throwing their support behind Hermann Goering, and the reformist faction, headed by Albert Speer.\n\nThe SS faction falls under the leadership of Esoteric fascist Heinrich Himmler, however his control over the SS is challenged by popular German SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich.\n\nThe death of Hitler causes millions of loyal, confused and scared Germans to march in the streets in commemoration of the man who made Germany the leader of the world. At his official funeral, thousands of NSDAP officials are seated with the 3 leaders of the coalition being allowed to make their own speech. Himmler is not invited to speak, however he is given a front row seat to the funeral and an elite Waffen-SS panzer regiment parades Hitler's body around Berlin.\n\nWith stability in the German Reich secured, the coalition declares war on both Russias, which are still at war with each other, and the anarchist Siberia, in the name of expanding Reichskommissariat Moskowien (Germany's Russian puppet state) and protecting the fabled Moskau from raids done by anarchists in Russia. With the Army, Navy and Airforce fully cooperating with each other, the German Reich executes the quickest invasion ever seen since the initial invasion of Russia during Operation Barbarossa. Elite panzer divisions demolish disorganized Russian troop formations as both Russia's capitulate within the month of November, 1966. All conquered lands except for Siberia are given to Reichskommissariat Moskowien, which is renamed Reichskommissariat Russland.\n\nRussian fascists within the white army, seeing German domination over Russia inevitable, defect and turn against the white leadership on the 17th November, causing the storming of the Whites capital, Vladivostok, by the Russian fascists, united under the leadership of Konstantin Rodzaevsky, after immigrating to White Russia from Harbin, Manchukuo to help the war effort.\n\nKonstantin Rodzaevsky and his Russian Fascist Party (RFP) met with delegates of the Reichstag the next day in Yekaterinburg, where the last tsar was murdered by Soviet guards. The city was recently captured by the modern panzer divisions of the Wehrmacht. During their meeting the RFP agrees to destroy the Whites from the inside in exchange for local autonomy over Russia. The Germans agree, and the Whites meet the same fate as they did in the first Russian civil war.\n\nWith Siberia conquered, Heinrich Himmler is appointed Reichskommissar of Reichskommissariat Sibirien. He 'graciously' accepts, and he moves to Vladivostok, renamed Wladiwostok.\n\nThe fall of Russia sends shockwaves throughout the world, reaffirming German dominance over the old world. The new world, however, stands firm against the fascist eagle and remains the land of the free. Canada and Mexico voluntarily join the U.S., now the North American Union (NAU). This brings the total stars on the flag to a large 92.\n\nMerely days after the capitulation of the remnants of the Soviet Union in Russia, delegates from the independent French state, the Turkish nation and the Italian Empire meet in Italian-occupied Cairo to discuss the creation of the Mare (Mediterranean) Triumvirate. Within 2 weeks, all delegates leave the conference room to announce the formalization of the alliance.\n\nThe newly formed NAU, seeing the rise of a bulwark against Germany hegemony in Europe, immediately recognizes the Italian-aligned France as the legitimate government of France, and talks begin between the NAU and delegates from all member nations of the Triumvirate about a potential greater defensive pact against Germany. However, these talks break down and eventually go nowhere.\n\n1968 goes down in this history as one of the most significant years of U.S/NAU history, with the Elections of 1968 as the final showdown between liberal democrats and the rising anti-fascist coalition. The coalition is made up of anarchists, socialists and left-wing democrats, led by former Democrat Hubert Humphrey, a placeholder president due to how divided the coalition is. The liberal democrats are the Democrat-Republican Party, which united 3 months before the election in the name of defending democracy within the NAU. They come under the leadership of widely popular Republican Henry Kissinger, who calls for peace and pioneers the policy of détente with the German Reich.\n\nThe election is incredibly close, with the Democrat-Republican Party barely passing the 270 votes required by just 3. However, this doesn't stop intense riots across the U.S., building up to the Nashville Massacre, when thousands of anti-fascists stormed the Democrat-owned State Capital and murdered everyone inside, declaring the state of Tennessee an independent state and holding the building for 2 days, until the army executed a siege on the capital. During the siege the anti-fascists fought till their last breath, some falling next to the corpses of their own victims.\n\nKissinger's victory speech calls for unity within these dark times, yet affirms his belief in preserving democracy across the world, by announcing his first act will be to safeguard nations that are democratic or are friendly to democracy.\n\nTragedy strikes the NAU as President Henry Kissinger is assassinated by a supposed Japanese agent during a rally for the 1970 midterm elections. As the president was driving to Florida State University to deliver a speech to its students, he was shot in the neck by a sniper as the car took a turn. Supporters watched in fear as the president slowly suffocated on his own blood, with both his wife and driver killed by the sniper. Secret Service agents rushed out from the cars in the president’s motorcade to find Kissinger unconscious, his suit soaked in blood. He was quickly rushed to the Capital Regional Medical Center, however the doctors weren’t able to save him in time.\n\nWithin minutes of his death, an emergency announcement is broadcasted to all citizens of the NAU by Kissinger’s Vice President, Democrat Edmund Muskie. With a heavy heart, he confirms Kissinger’s death in the assassination, and swears to avenge his death by finding the perpetrators. The assassin is quickly caught, and is revealed to be an undoccumented Japanese man, quickly raising suspicions on Japan for their involvement in Kissinger’s assassination.\n\n36 minutes after Muskie’s broadcast, the Japanese make their own announcement hosted by their delegate to the NAU. In the announcement they both condone the assassination and deny any involvement in it, claiming that the assassin in question was actually a former Japanese agent turned German Gestapo sleeper agent. The Reichstag doesn’t comment on this accusation.\n\nThis announcement, however, is not enough for the NAU as the entire Pacific fleet heads to Pearl Harbor, and naval exercises occur near the Japanese Co-Prosperity Sphere’s maritime border. In retaliation, the Japanese set their naval fleet to full combat readiness, and prepare plans for quick aerial attacks on NAU bases in the Pacific.\n\nIn the end, the Japanese strike first. 2 weeks after Kissinger’s assassination, The Japanese engages the American navy north of Wake island, with the Battle of Wake resulting in a decisive Japanese victory, however each side takes heavy material losses, with a total of 15 carriers being sunk.\n\nDespite Japanese victory in the Battle of Wake, the Imperial navy is forced to retreat back to the home islands to repair, making the Pacific ocean uncontested. The NAU uses this opportunity to declare a state of war between the NAU and Japanese Empire, allowing Muskie to heavily militarize the American economy, and setting aside billions of dollars to fund a naval buildup never seen before.\n\nWhile the Americans prepare, so do the Japanese, with fortifications being built across the entirety of Japan, making a naval invasion impossible. The Japanese also launch their plan for a swift conquest of American holdings in the Pacific, however they only are able to gain a foot-hold in a vast minority of the islands, and are forced to entrench themselves until one of the two powers can acquire naval superiority over the other.\n\nWith naval domination temporarily achieved, Muskie uses this opportunity to execute Operation Overthrow, with an elite task force of American marines landing in Tokyo and overwhelming the city’s defenses. The Japanese emperor, Akihito, barely escapes from the palace before it is burnt down.\n\nWhat will soon become known as the Burning of Tokyo sparks a fire in the Japanese population as countless, heavily unarmed, Japanese citizens charge the capital in a desperate attempt to completely wipe out the Americans. They succeed through the use of human wave tactics, however at a horrible price. 500 thousand Japanese soldiers die, in exchange for killing 10 thousand Americans. This massacre demonstrates to Muskie that conventional means of warfare will not win the war.\n\n---------------------------------------—\n\n**Part 2 - Die Großen Krisen - The Great Crises**\n\n1970 marks one of the greatest crisis within the German Reich, as Konstantin Rodzaevsky and his cabinet are executed in an well planned coup by prominent Russian fascist Anastasy Vonsiatsky, who immediately declares Reichskommissariat Russland, now the Russian State, an independent nation, and seeks to reclaim the Russian Empire's former territories.\n\nWithin hours, Russian troops build fortifications in the Ural Mountains. With mountain fortifications making it almost impossible to attack, German troops can only watch as a surprisingly organized Russian Army invades Central Asia, crushing their resistance and reaching the bottom right of the Caspian Sea within a month. The Reichstag avoids discussing the clear rebellion for 2 months until border skirmishes happen between the bolstered Russian shock troopers and the disenchanted SS army in Siberia. In response, 70% of all Waffen-SS Panzer divisions are rerouted to Siberia, however upon reaching Wladiwostok find the harsh Siberian wasteland too difficult to sustain a military campaign. Realizing the only viable front is Central Asia, the division in Wladiwostok are once again rerouted to mobilize on the southern border of the Russian State.\n\nDespite German technological advancements, the panzers are unable to prepare for battle before the Russians secure and fortify their entire border with the German Empire. Despite firm demands for the Russians to be left alone by both the NAU and Japanese Empire, the elite Fallschirmjäger, under the guidance of paratrooper genius Kurt Student, manage to execute a large-scale airborne invasion of the Russian State’s capital in Ekaterinburg. The undermanned and undertrained defenders of the city stood no match against the greatest soldiers produced by the Third Reich and they reached the center of the city.\n\n'Anastasy Vonsiatsky, expecting the Germans to rush into his heavily fortified governmental building, is shocked to see the German troops retreating. However, he has little time to find out why as a modified version of the V-2 rocket detonates directly on top of the building, instantly vaporising anyone inside and turns the building into rubble and debris. Hours after the attack, all 3 leaders of the Unity-Koalition make a press announcement, stating “Through superior German will, the Russian tyrant has been executed. We welcome all those who wish to surrender before we liberate your homeland.”' - anecdote?\n\nBoth the NAU and Japanese fall silent after this display of German supremacy. Without a strong leader and international support, the Russian State collapses in a day. With brigades on the border mutinying and even turning on each other, the Wehrmacht High Command executes Phase 2 of their plan, a carefully targeted aerial campaign, seeking to both wreak havoc on ground forces and flatten major cities. This final move is the nail in the coffin for the Russian State, as the army leaders still alive from the attack all offer unconditional surrender.\n\nThe de facto capitulation of the Russian State allows the reichstag to balkanise Russia into 3 states:  Reichskommissariat Moskowien, Reichskommissariat Ostrussland (East Russia) and Reichskommissariat Westsibirien (West Siberia). Reinhard Heydrich is made Reichskommissar of Moskowien, weakening Himmler’s control over the SS.\n\nHeydrich’s rule over Moskowien leads to thousands of deaths daily, as he orders the execution of those he deems unworthy and sends the rest to work in labor camps. This turns Moskau into a ghost city, with only Germans left there to profit from the properties seized from the Russian people.\n\nYears later, the second crisis of the Reich begins as Heydrich publicly denounces Himmler’s rule over the SS in a speech made in Moskau. As fanatical SS soldiers cheer loudly, the elite divisions of the Waffen-SS are split as they militarise on both borders of Ostrussland. With imminent invasion upon them, the central government of the kommissariat collapses, prompting a swift push from both sides of the SS to secure as much of the former Russian land as possible for the upcoming struggle.\n\nThis pure defiance of the reichstag causes heated debate within it, and the 3 leaders eventually decide to demand both sides demilitarise or face consequences.\n\nUnfortunately for the slavic people of Ostrussland, neither side compromises, and Ostrussland descends into all out chaos within weeks. SS-Battalions form and attack defensive lines, and civilian casualties reach past 50k within a month.\n\nHimmler and Heydrich both send the call for loyal units to relocate to the border, and panzers fight panzers in the thick Russian snow. Heydrich’s elite soldiers storm the city of Novosibirsk, massacring all inhabitants and preparing to transform the ruins of the city into the most heavily fortified bastion in Russia.\n\nHimmler attempts to gain advantage in the north, routing the majority of his panzer strike-force towards Noril’sk, meeting Heydrichs Einsatzgruppen. The battle that ensued lasted 3 days, and was a decisive Heydrich victory, as the Einsatzgruppen employed guerilla tactics to slowly pick off Himmler’s tanks.\n\nThis split in the SS doesn’t stop at just Ostrussland, as the entirety of the Reich erupts in upheaval, as brother fights brother in the streets of Berlin. However, with superior weaponry and tacticionship, Heydrich defeats Himmler and in the final days of Himmler’s control over the SS, he orders his remaining divisions to spread out through Ostrussland and form partisan groups, brutally slaughtering the already diminishing population of the countryside.\n\nWith Himmler out of the picture, Heydrich assumed command of the entirety of the Russian lands, establishing Reichskommissariat Russland. The struggle is not over, however, as the Unity-Koalition demands that Heydrich dismantle his empire into 2 states, with the Reichstag taking control over Sibirien, and Heydrich’s SS retaining leadership of Zentralrussland.\n\nAfter a tense showdown between the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS, Heydrich agrees to the terms and subsequently helps appoint a new government to the Sibirien lands.\n\nThis civil war within the SS does not go unnoticed to the wider world, as rebels across the reichskommissariats prepare to revolt. Merely 3 months after Himmler’s fall from grace, an international partisan organisation known as the “Free Liberation Force” stages a reich-wide insurrection across the Reich’s colonies, mainly in Spain and Scandinavia. This small insurrection quickly leads to an open revolt against the reich within its colonies, as the governments of Spanien, Skandinavien and Ukraine are dissolved and democratic liberties are restored to their people. During the chaos, numerous separatist partisan groups rise up, such as the Polish Home Army, in the Warsaw Insurrection, and various other rebels, such as British fascists near London, the Russian Red Army and the Paris Commune. - **1970-80s??**\n\n---------------------------------------—\n\n**Part 3 - Fugue**\n\nActor 1: _**Felipe González Márquez**_\n\nBorn under the Francoist regime imposed by the Germans, Felipe experienced firsthand the tyranny of Franco, which was further enhanced under the direction of the Nazi party. Studying at Seville University, he met his soon-to-be comrades of the _Spanish Socialist Workers' Party._ Throughout Franco's regime, he would be the main figurehead of anti-Falangist sentiment, slowly organising and gaining popularity. After witnessing the many crises of the Greater German Reich, he, alongside his many friends of liberty across the Reich, would rise up to form the \"Free Liberation Force\".\n\nActor 2: _**Johan Nygaardsvold**_\n\nA vague character in Norwegian politics, Johan quickly rose to prominence when he was asked to form a government by the Norwegian Monarchy. However, his government would not last long against the tide of Nazi aggression. He would run said government as an exiled one in London. With the fall of London, he used his obscurity to return to Norway, where he would slowly build up resistance to Vidkun Quisling's regime. Throughout the years, his resistance movement spread throughout the entirety of Scandinavia, gradually intensifying attacks on the fascist government. When the time came, he would rise up along his brothers in arms to create the \"Free Liberation Force\".\n\n# **Pictures:**\n\nScenario One Map (unfinished):\n\nlol it corrupted kekw\n\nEurope Free Liberation Force + Separatists\n\n![[Pasted image 20220508202858.png]]","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.543775327Z","tags":null},"/Brilliant-Course-Complex-Numbers":{"title":"","content":"\n# Brilliant Course Complex Numbers\n\nNOTE: Read the [[Number Sets Notes]] page before starting here. \n\n#### Introduction to Complex Numbers\n\n\"Given that x is a real number, how many values of x fulfil the equation:\n\n$x^2 = -16$\n\n**Answer:**\n\nNo real numbers can fulfil this equation.\n\nWe are looking for a number that when squared, is the absolute value of -16, and then maybe we could make it negative.

From this, we know that Calcium has 4 electron shells. Thus, Calcium has a period number of 4.\n\t\t\t- **Group number** represents the number of **valence electrons** of an element.\n\t\t\t\t- There are exceptions: e.g. the transition metals, however for yr 10 you don't need to know about why that happens.\n\t\t\t\t- For example, Chlorine has a group number of 17, however if we pretend the transition metals don't exist, it would have a group number of 7. Thus, Chlorine would have 7 valence electrons. Chlorine's electron configuration is 2, 8, 7 and does indeed have 7 valence electrons.\n\t- 3 (main) types of bonding:\n\t\t- But why do elements bond? In general, atoms want to each a **stable electron configuration**. What that means is that they want their **outer** (valence) shell to be **full** of electrons (in general this is 8). They can do this in a variety of ways, by losing, gaining or sharing electrons.\n\t\t- We can also say they want the electron configuration of a **noble gas**, as noble gasses already have this configuration.\n\t\t- *Note that bonding works on a spectrum of sorts. We can have pure metallic on one side, pure ionic in the middle, and pure covalent on the other side. However, there will always be certain compounds/molecules that do not fit in this category. E.g. $SiO_2$ can be considered 'covalent', however due to Silicon being a metalloid, $SiO_2$ (silica) is actually a covalent **network** substance, unlike the molecules you will encounter in yr 10.*\n\t\t- Ionic bonding:\n\t\t\t- Between metals and non-metals.\n\t\t\t- *When metals and non-metals collide, metals will lose their valence electrons to form positive ions (cations), and non-metals will accept these ions, forming negative ions (anions).

Elements closer to the right have a weaker metallic nature.\n\t\t* **Metallic nature** refers to the readiness of an atom to lose its valence electrons, like how most metals lose their valence electrons to produce the metallic structure.\n\t\t* In terms of chemical reactivity: \n\t\t\t* For metals, elements become more reactive as they get closer to the **bottom right** corner of the periodic table.\n\t\t\t* For non-metals, elements become more reactive as they get closer to the **bottom right** corner.\n\t\t\t\t* This does not include the noble gasses, as they are inert and do not react well.\n\t* Nomenclature:\n\t\t* Metals formulae:\n\t\t\t* Just write the metal's symbol.\n\t\t\t* e.g. $Ag_{(s)}$\n\t\t* Metals nomenclature:\n\t\t\t* Just state the metal.\n\t\t\t* e.g. Silver\n\t\t* Ionic formulae:\n\t\t\t* Write both metal and non-metal ions, but **balance it** so that the total charge of the compound is 0.\n\t\t\t* e.g. $BaCl$ would be wrong, because Barium has a charge of 2+ and Chlorine has a charge of 1-. This would result in a +1 charge.\n\t\t\t* The correct formulae for Barium chloride is $BaCl_2$.\n\t\t\t* Positive ions come before negative ions.\n\t\t\t\t* **Unless** the negative ion is $CH_3COO^-$. In this case, we put the positive ion last.\n\t\t\t\t\t* *This is because the cation is not attracted to the initial carbon, which has 4 covalent bonds to 3 hydrogens and the other carbon, and thus has an stable electron configuration.*\n\t\t\t\t\t* *Instead, the last oxygen is actually the atom that is negatively charged. Thus, we place the positive ion last to indicate that it is bonded with the charged oxygen atom, not the carbon atom.*\n\t\t* Ionic nomenclature:\n\t\t\t* Just state the positive and negative ions, in that order. \n\t\t\t* e.g. Barium Chloride\n\t\t\t* Do not include charges\n\t\t\t* e.g. Barium 2+ Chloride - is wrong\n\t\t\t\t* UNLESS the positive ion is a **transition metal**. Then, we have to indicate its valency via roman numerals.\n\t\t\t\t* This should be easy to figure out, as you'll be given the ionic compound as a formulae or will be told its valency.\n\t\t\t\t* e.g. if we were asked to write the name of $Cu(OH)_2$, from this formula we would be able to deduce Copper's valency in this case to be 2+. Thus, $Cu(OH)_2$'s name would be Copper (II) Hydroxide.\n\t\t* Covalent formulae\n\t\t\t* Write the elements with the number of elements as subscript.\n\t\t\t* e.g. Diphosphorus pentoxide is $P_2O_5$.\n\t\t* Covalent nomenclature\n\t\t\t* For every element, we use a prefix to describe the number of atoms of said element in the given molecule.\n\t\t\t* The prefixes are (in order of increasing number of atoms (mono = 1)):\n\t\t\t\t* Mono\n\t\t\t\t* Di\n\t\t\t\t* Tri\n\t\t\t\t* Tetra\n\t\t\t\t* Penta\n\t\t\t\t* Hexa\n\t\t\t\t* Hepta\n\t\t\t\t* Octa\n\t\t\t\t* Nona\n\t\t\t\t* Deca\n\t\t\t* HOWEVER, the prefix **mono** is never used for the **first element**.\n\t\t\t* The **second element** will end with an 'ide' prefix.

Melting point is an indicator of the energy required to separate particles into a liquid or gaseous form.\n* Hardness: In chemistry, we think of hardness as the relative strength of the chemical bonds within a substance. In other words, it is how resistant a solid is to force applied.\n* Density: how compact the particles in a molecule are.\n* Electrical conductivity: The ability for a substance to conduct a current of electricity. For a substance to be conductive, it must contain **mobile, charged particles**.\n* Thermal conductivity: The transfer of energy due to molecular motion. For a substance to conduct heat, generally it must have mobile particles to transfer energy.\n* Brittle: To be hard, but fracture easily.\n\n\n**Solutions:**\n\t- **Solution:** A mixture in which the solute particles are homogenously distributed throughout particles of solvent\n\t      - Can be solid (e.g. Bronze(Metal alloys)), liquid (e.g. Sea water) or gas (e.g. Air)\n\t- **Aqueous Solution:** Liquid solution where the solvent is water\n\t- **Solvent:** The major component of a solution by mass\n    - **Solute:** The minor components of a solution by mass\n    - **Dissolving:** Solid particles are separated and distributed throughout the mixture, increasing solution concentration.\n    - **Unsaturated:** Contains less solute than the solvent is normally able to dissolve\n    - **Saturated:** Contain the same amount of solute that the solvent is normally able to dissolve\n\t    - Rate of dissolving and crystallisation are equal\n\t- **Supersaturated:** Contains more solute than the solvent is normally able to dissolve\n\t\t- Can be achieved through heating and dissolving, then carefully cooling the solution.\n\n**Pure substances:** A substance that has a fixed composition. This includes elements and compounds.S\n\n**Valency:** The **combining power** of an atom, and is equal to **the number of hydrogen atoms** it could combine with or displace.\n\n**Precipitate:** An insoluble solid produced by two solutions being added together.\n\n**Mole:** The amount of particles of a substance that is equal to the number of particles in 12 grams of Carbon-12.\n\n**Physical Properties Copy-Paste Moment**\n\n- **Ionic Bonding:**\n\t- **High Melting and Boiling Points**\n\t\t- Within the ionic lattice, there exists a strong electrostatic attractive force between unlike ions. Thus, a high average kinetic energy of particles is required to separate these ions into the liquid and gaseous phase. As energy is proportional to temperature, this means ionic compounds will have a higher melting/boiling point. \n\t- **Hardness and Brittleness**\n\t\t- When force is applied to the ionic lattice, layers of alternating ions slide over each other. This causes the distance between like charges to decrease, creating a net repulsive force. This fractures the ionic lattice, making ionic compounds brittle. However, the strong electrostatic attractive force between unlike ions still remains, and requires much more force to break. Thus, ionic substances are hard.\n\t- **Conductivity in Solid, Liquid and Aqueous states**\n\t\t- For a substance to be conductive, it must contain mobile, charged particles.\n\t\t- In the solid state:\n\t\t\t- Ionic solids exist as an lattice of alternating ions.\n\t\t\t- These ions are rigid with regards to the overall structure.\n\t\t\t- As these ions are rigid, they are not mobile despite being charged.\n\t\t\t- Thus, ionic substances are not conductive in the solid phase.\n\t\t- In the molten phase:\n\t\t\t- In the molten phase, ions have high kinetic energy and are free to move **independently**.\n\t\t\t- As ions they are charged (positive or negative).\n\t\t\t- Thus, in the molten phase ionic compounds are very conductive.\n\t\t- In the aqueous phase:\n\t\t\t- Ions are attracted to water molecules, which move freely. This means ions are also mobile in an aqueous solution.\n\t\t\t- Ions are also charged.\n\t\t\t- Thus, in the aqueous phase ionic compounds are very conductive.\n\t- **Comparison Question**\n\t\t- e.g. Element X is a Group 1 element, Element Y is a group 2 element. Which one has the stronger metallic bond?\n\t\t\t- Element Y. As it releases more valence electrons, it becomes more positively charged. Thus, a greater electrostatic force of attraction will exist between Element Y's cations and the sea of delocalised electrons, i.e., the metallic bond. Thus, the metallic bond will be stronger.\n\n- **Metallic Bonding:**\n\t- **Malleability and Ductility**\n\t\t- The metallic bond is non-directional, as it is between metal cations and the sea of delocalised electrons.\n\t\t- This means when force is applied, cations can **move in relation to each other** without breaking the metallic bond.\n\t\t- Thus, metals can change shape without breaking, and thus are highly malleable and ductile.\n\t- **Thermal and Electrical Conductivity**\n\t\t- Thermal:\n\t\t\t- To be a thermal conductor, a substance must contain mobile particles to transfer energy via collisions.\n\t\t\t- Within metal solids, there is a sea of delocalised electrons.\n\t\t\t- These electrons are mobile, and thus can carry kinetic(heat) energy.\n\t\t\t- Furthermore, metal cations can vibrate, which further carries kinetic energy.\n\t\t\t- Thus, metals are good thermal conductors.\n\t- **Moderate to High Melting and Boiling Points**\n\t\t- With a metal solid, there exists a strong electrostatic force of attraction between metal cations and the sea of delocalised electrons. Thus, a high average kinetic energy of particles is required to disrupt the metallic lattice. As energy is proportional to temperature, this means metal solids will have a higher melting/boiling point.\n\n- **Covalent Molecular Bonding:**\n\t- **Low Melting and Boiling Points**\n\t\t- For covalent molecular substances, there exists a very strong intramolecular force within molecules, but a weak intermolecular force between molecules. Thus, less energy is required to overcome this weak force and separate molecules. As energy is proportional to temperature, covalent molecular substances have a low melting/boiling point.\n\t- **Non-conductivity**\n\t\t- For a substance to conduct electricity, it must contain mobile, charged particles. In covalent molecules, electrons remain localised either as within an atom's electron cloud or as part of a shared pair of electrons in a covalent bond. Thus, there are no delocalised electrons, which would be mobile and charged. Furthermore, there are no ions. Thus, there are no mobile charged particles and covalent molecular substances are not electrically conductive.\n\t- **Softness and Brittleness** \n\t\t- When force is applied to a covalent molecular substance, the weak intermolecular forces are easily overcome, and molecules are separated from each other. This makes covalent molecular substances soft. Furthermore, as this weak intermolecular structure is easily overcome. this makes covalent molecular substances very brittle.\n\n- **Covalent Network Bonding:**\n\t- **High Melting and Boiling Points**\n\t\t- Within a covalent network substance, strong covalent bonds exist between all atoms within the structure. For this structure to be disrupted, a large amount of **particle kinetic energy** is required. As energy is proportional to temperature, covalent network substances will have a very high melting/boiling point.\n\t- **Hardness and Brittleness**\n\t\t- A lot of force is required to disrupt atoms in a covalent network substance. Thus, these substances are hard and brittle, as applying such a force would fracture the network.\n\t- **Thermal and Electrical Conductivity**\n\t\t- Thermal:\n\t\t\t- To conduct heat, a substance must contain mobile particles to carry kinetic energy. Electrons are rigid in the covalent network structure, either as part of lone pairs or bonding pairs. The atoms are also held in place. Thus, there are no mobile particles present to carry kinetic energy and thus these substances are thermally non-conductive.\n\t\t- Electrical:\n\t\t\t- To conduct electricity, a substance must contain charged particles. Electrons are rigid in the covalent network structure, either as part of lone pairs or bonding pairs. The atoms are also held in place. Thus, there are no mobile charged particles and thus these substances are not electrically conductive. \n**Intermolecular Forces and Solubility**:\n- ","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.543775327Z","tags":null},"/Chemistry-Resources-review":{"title":"","content":"\n# Chemistry Textbook review\n\n## Number 1: Lucarelli\n- Solid 9/10. Love the author, love the questions, love the style of learning.\n\t- To be honest, the chapters are kinda mediocre. They're good to briefly read as revision, and they're definitely better than Pearson, but other than that, they aren't too great.\n\t- Their sets are **long**. But the extended questions are where its at, and their answers are *top-tier*. Would definitely recommend tackling Lucarelli first when learning a new topic, just as consolidation and getting used to the style of questions for said topic.\n\t- Overall, Lucarelli (**Essential Chemistry** is its official name, btw) is a great buy.\n\n## Number 2: Chemistry Past papers\n- 8/10. The best way in getting better in chemistry (well I think so anyways, its not working out too well for me... :( ) is doing practice papers. Just remember to be harsh on yourself if you don't have a marking key, and in general don't be generous to yourself.\n- psst I do have a [github for chemistry papers](https://github.com/EddieTheEd/ATAR-Yr11-Exams-Tests), if you want it to be a proper website how about you go and find your own papers, huh?\n\n## Number 3: WACE Study Guide\n- 7/10. It fulfils its purpose as a revision guide, but that's all.\n\t- Its short summary pages suck. The diagrams and stuff are decent, but the rest is either common knowledge or things you probably should know already ~~unless you haven't been studying~~. \n\t- Review questions are mediocre. Good for some quick revision though. But don't rely on the answers. Let them guide you to the correct solution, but use your common sense on how much marks the question is/how long the answer should be. This depends on the topic.\n\t- Trial tests are awesome. They somewhat correlate to the difficulty of actual tests, and always come with an answer key. \n\t- Overall, I recommend buying the book, only because its trial tests are great.\n\n## Number 4: STAWA\n- *Man, I hate this book.*\n- 5/10. Don't bother reading through the experiments, the sets are where its at.\n\t- STAWA sets are repetitive, boring, and lengthy. Good for some topics, not good for others.\n\t- **DO NOT READ THE ANSWERS FOR STAWA SETS. THEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS WRONG.** \n\t- Try and find 'worked solutions for STAWA' online or from your friends.\n\t- Overall, I would recommend trying to find an online copy of STAWA, but buying it is a last resort. For some reason, my hard copy's binder just disintegrated within mere weeks of buying it. That probably explains my negative attitude towards the book...\n\n## Number 5: Pearson\n- *I have nightmares thinking about Pearson chapters...*\n- 3/10. I absolutely hate this book. It has no merits, yet for some reason all schools recommend buying it.\n\t- Questions suck. That's all. Questions like \"3. Why does Australia store more water per person than any other country?\" (pg 344, Chapter 15.1 Review) fill me with dread. Their answers aren't better either.\n\t- Reading through some of these chapters are what I recall as some of the worst hours of my life. Having learned about 'flocculation' and fluoridation, and how Sodium Hexafluoride is added to drinking water to supposedly \"harden tooth enamel\", I think its safe to say this book is horrible.\n\t- Overall, you may end up buying it because it's required by your school. But please, try avoiding buying it at all costs. Do not give the people who wrote it any more money.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.543775327Z","tags":null},"/Chemistry-Stoichiometry-Notes":{"title":"","content":"\n# Chemistry Stoichiometry Notes\n\nBefore starting to learn about stoichiometry, think about this little analogy.\n\nLet's say I have two cubes, one being 100 grams of pure Carbon, and another being 100 grams of Aluminium.\n\nNow, are there the same number of atoms within both of the cubes?\n\nNo, because Carbon, being a lighter element, will require more atoms to maintain a specific weight than a metal such as Aluminium.\n\n\nThis is where **moles** come in. Essentially, moles are an intermediary unit to describe the relationship between molar mass (which is basically a measurement of relative atomic mass between elements) and mass (in grams).\n\nNow, if you have a periodic table, you might notice some numbers under elements. This is the **relative atomic mass** of an element (this number is based on the average natural abundance of this element which is analysed using mass spectrometry (you don't need this)). \n\nWe could measure everything in grams, but then all our calculations would use *really* small numbers, that would be overly complicated to use for calculations. (e.g. Carbon-12 weighs $1.9926 \\times 10^{-23}$g)\n\nInstead, we use **relative atomic mass** to compare the mass of an element with the mass of **one twelfth the mass of a Carbon-12 atom**. \n\nThus, for example, we would describe Chlorine's *relative atomic mass* as 35.45, as the average atom of Chlorine is 35.45 times the mass of one twelfth the mass of a Carbon-12 atom.\n\n\nSimilarly, we have another unit called **molar mass** (M). It is defined as:\n\n\u003eThe mass of one mole of an element's atoms.\n\nBut what is a mole?\n\nAs said before, a mole is a unit we use to connect number of atoms to grams.\n\nEssentially, a mole of **any element** has a mass that is equal to its **relative atomic mass**, in grams.\n\nFor example, if I had one mole of Carbon, I would have exactly 12.01 grams of Carbon. (its relative atomic mass is 12.01)\n\u003eNote: Similarly, One mole of Carbon-12 is 12 grams (Carbon-12 on its on has a relative atomic mass of 12).\n\nThat's cool and all, but surely there has to be some universal constant to represent this.\n\nWell, **relative atomic mass** is based on **one twelfth the mass of a Carbon-12 atom**. So naturally, we need some equivalent in describing a mole.\n\nThis is where **Avogadro's Number** comes in.\n\nAvogadro's Number is the exact quantity of Carbon-12 atoms to have a mass of 12 grams.\n\nIn general,\n\n\u003eAvogadro's number represents the number of an element's atoms required to have a mass of that element's relative atomic mass.\n\nHaving this quantity of an element is equivalent to a **mole** of that element.\n\nTherefore, given that Molar Mass is the **mass of one mole of its atoms**, and a **mole** is related to **relative atomic mass**, unsurprisingly **Molar Mass** and **Relative atomic mass** are **exactly the same!**\n\nExcept that molar mass is measured in grams per mole, whereas Relative atomic mass does not have a unit of measurement, as its *relative*. \n\nThus, if I had 22.99 grams of Sodium, which is numerically equivalent to the Molar mass of Sodium (and Sodium's relative atomic mass), I would also have 1 mole of Sodium, which has Avogadro's number of atoms.\n\nNow, here's a quick question:\n\nWhat's the molar mass of oxygen *gas*?\n\n\nWell, we know that oxygen gas contains two atoms of oxygen. This is because oxygen is diatomic. We also know that molar mass is exactly the same as Relative atomic mass.\n\nThe Relative Atomic Mass of Oxygen is 16.00, but this is for a single atom. We're looking for the relative atomic mass of 2 atoms, so we just **times by 2**.\n\nTherefore, the Molar mass of Oxygen is 32.00 $g\\ mol^{-1}$. *Remember to write $g\\ mol^{-1}$!*\n\n\nHere's a harder question:\n\nWhat's the molar mass of Sulphuric acid?\n\nFirst, let's identify the following:\n1. What elements are we looking for\n2. What ratio are these elements present in\n\nSulphuric acid's formula is $H_2SO_4$.\n\nThus, there are:\n* 2 Hydrogen atoms\n* 1 Sulfur atom\n* 4 Oxygen atoms.\n\nNow, we can write each of the element's Molar mass (i.e. its relative atomic mass (i use relative atomic mass cause its alot easier)) and like before, multiply it by how many atoms there are of the element.\n\n$2 \\times 1.008 + 1 \\times 32.07 + 4 \\times 16.00$\n\n= 98.086 $g\\ mol^{-1}$.\n\n\nNow that's done, you're ready for one of the most easiest formulas in the world.\n\n```ad-info\n$n = \\frac{m}{M}$\n\n```\nwhere:\n* n = number of moles, measured in moles (mol)\n* m = mass, measured in grams (g)\n* M = molar mass, measured in grams per mole ($g\\ mol^{-1}$)\n\nThis formula will covert grams to moles, and moles to grams, so you can have the best of both worlds (i.e. a unit of measurement used everywhere and a unit of measurement that can be converted to number of atoms easily)\n\nNow, example question:\n\nWhat is the number of atoms in 50 grams of Silver Ethanoate ($CH_3COOAg$)(btw Ms Pilling said for ethanoates you put the cation at the end. Something to do with the way ethanoates bond as a polyatomic ion)\n\nFirst, there are:\n* 2 Carbon atoms (12.01)\n* 3 Hydrogen atoms (1.008)\n* 2 Oxygen atoms (16.00)\n* 1 Silver atom (107.868)\n\nTherefore, the molar mass of Silver Ethanoate is:\n\n$2 \\times 12.01 + 3 \\times 1.008 + 2 \\times 16.00 + 1 \\times 107.868$\n\nWhich is 166.912 $g\\ mol^{-1}$.\n\nBut we're not done yet! Now we can use our amazing formula:\n\n$n = \\frac{m}{M}, n = \\frac{50}{166.912}$\n\nThus, the number of moles in 50g of Silver Ethanoate is 0.2996 **mol**.\n\nTherefore, since a mole represents $6.022 \\times 10^{23}$ atoms, \n\nThen number of atoms in 50g of Silver Ethanoate is:\n\n$0.29776 \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{23}$\n\nWhich is: $1.804 \\times 10^{23}$ atoms!\n\n\nOk, now you understand basic stoichiometry, and moles to grams conversions. But what about moles inside of moles?\n\nLet's say I had 2 moles of Sulphuric acid ($H_2SO_4$). How many moles of Hydrogen atoms are contained inside?\n\nWell, the answer is surprisingly very simple. We look at the **subscript** of the element we're looking for. In this case, Hydrogen's subscript is 2, so we simply **multiply** the moles of the **whole molecule** by the subscript.\n\nThus, the number of Hydrogen moles is **4**.\n\nSimilarly the number of Sulphate ion ($SO_4^{-2}$) moles is **2**. (There is only one molecule of Sulphate) (Imagine $H_2SO_{4}$ as $H_2(SO_4)_1$)\n\nAlso, the number of Oxygen moles is 8. (Oxygen has a subscript of 4.)\n\nOk, time to throw you in the deep end.\n\n\nI have 5 kilograms of Nitric Acid ($HNO_{3(aq)}$) and I mixed it with an excess amount of Sodium Hydroxide ($NaOH_{aq}$). \n\nFind all the products of this reaction, and find how many moles of Sodium Nitrate are produced (hint hint sodium nitrate is one of the products)\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we write the equation:\n\n$HNO_{3(aq)} + NaOH_{s} \\rightarrow NaNO_{3(aq)} + H_2O_{(l)}$ \n\nNote that the ratio between all the reactants and products is: **1 : 1 : 1 :1**\n\n\nNow here's the thing about moles within chemical formulas:\n\nLet's say I had 2 substances in my chemical reaction. They could be **any** of the substances, reactants or products.\n\nLet's call them aA, and bB, where the small letters are the coefficients and the big elements are the substances.\n\n(In our case, we'll choose Nitric Acid and Sodium Nitrate.)\n\nNow, here's another amazingly simple formula:\n\nFor two **substances** in an equation (aA, bB),\n\n```ad-info \n$n(A) = \\frac{a}{b} \\times n(B)$\n```\n\n\nThus, \n\n$n(HNO_{3(aq)})= \\frac{1}{1} \\times n(NaNO_{3(aq)})$\n\n$\\therefore n(HNO_{3(aq)})= n(NaNO_{3(aq)})$\n\nOk, now we need to actually calculate the number of moles of Nitric Acid:\n\n$n = \\frac{m}{M}, n=\\frac{5000}{1 \\times 1.008 + 1 \\times 14.01 + 3 \\times 16.00}$\n\n$\\therefore n(HNO_{3(aq)}) = 79.342$ mol.\n\n$\\therefore n(NaNO_{3(aq)})=$ ==79.342 mol.== (1:1 ratio)\n\nGreat! You understand the basics of stoichiometry now. \n\nHere are a few practice questions:\n\n\n1. For a science experiment, I burn 4 moles of ethanol ($C_2H_6O_{(l)}$) in an open flame. How much moles of oxygen is consumed, assuming complete combustion (yea there are other types of combustion .-.)?\n2. Pure oxygen is prepared for laboratory use through the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (sidenote, its catalytic) in the following formula: $2H_2O_{2(aq)} \\rightarrow O_{2(g)} + 2H_2O_{(l)}$                                                    If I needed 20 grams of oxygen gas for an experiment, how many moles of hydrogen peroxide would I need?\n3. Given the formula: $Na_2CO_3.10H_20_{(aq)} + 2HCl_{(aq)} \\rightarrow CO_{2(g)} + 11H_2O_{(l)} + 2NaCl_{(aq)}$ How many **grams** of Sodium Carbonate-10-water produces 60 grams of Sodium Chloride?\n\n **Answers:** (don't look if you actually want to do it yourself, otherwise I guess you can see how I would do it)\n\n1. First, write the chemical equation:\n\n$2C_2H_6OH_{(l)} + 6O_{2(g)} \\rightarrow 4CO_{2(g)} + 6H_2O_{(l)}$ \n\nNote the 2 : 6 : 4 : 6 ratio.\n\nI'm comparing ethanol and oxygen. Therefore, I'm looking at a 2 to 6 ratio.\n\nTherefore, $n(O_{2(g)}) = \\frac{6}{2} \\times n(C_2H_6OH_{(l)})$\n\n= $\\frac{6}{2} \\times 4$ = ==12 mol.==\n\n2. First, we're in grams so I'm going to convert into moles (in general you should always convert into moles, at least you'll get a mark for that)\n\n$n=\\frac{m}{m}, n(O_{2(g)})=\\frac{20}{2\\times16} = 0.625$ mol.\n\nTherefore, \n\n$n(H_2O_{2(aq)}) = \\frac{2}{1}\\times n(O_{2(g)})$\n\n= ==1.25 mol.==\n\n3. Convert grams to moles.\n\n$n = \\frac{m}{M}, n(NaCl_{(aq)}) = \\frac{60}{22.99 + 35.45} = 1.0267$ mol.\n\nTherefore,\n\n$n(Na_2CO_3.10H_20_{(aq)}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\times n(NaCl_{(aq)})=0.51335$ mol.\n\nHowever, we're looking for **grams**. Thus, we have to reconvert from moles to grams.\n\n$n=\\frac{m}{M}, m=nM, m(Na_2CO_3.10H_20_{(aq)})=0.51335 \\times (2 \\times 22.99 + 1 \\times 12.01 + 3 \\times 16 + 10(2 \\times 1.008 + 1 \\times 16))$ (preferably its not on one giant line)\n\n= 146.89 **g**!\n\n\nGreat! Now you have a relatively good understanding of basic stoichiometry. \n\n\n\nNow, time for **gasses.**\n\nRemember that laboratory question about oxygen? Perhaps you noticed something wrong about measuring oxygen in grams. You would be correct, as in general, we do not have oxygen in solid form, which is what we use grams for. \n\nInstead, since oxygen is a gas, it occupy **volume**. \n\nInstead of grams, we use **litres**. \n\nSounds logical, right? All we need to do is change the grams to litres, change some numbers around and everything will be fine, right?\n\nNo.\n\nGasses are influenced by both **temperature** and **pressure**.\n\nIf I increase the temperature of a gas, following the kinetic theory of gas, then on average gas particles will have more kinetic energy, making them spread out and thus want to occupy more space (if they don't get this space, pressure increases but you don't need to know that).\n\nSimilarly, increasing pressure will reduce the volume of a gas. Think about it as you're crushing gas particles in some sort of compressor. Adding pressure will push the particles closer.\n\nWe measure pressure in pascals (Pa).\n\nFor example, average atmospheric pressure at sea level is described as 101.325 kPa, which is equivalent to one standard atmosphere (atm) of pressure.\n\nWe measure temperature in kelvin (K) (actually we usually use degrees Celcius). \n\nWhat makes kelvin useful is the concept of absolute zero.\n\nHere's a side-note about absolute zero you can read if you're really interested:\n\n```ad-info\nThe Kinetic theory of gasses states that all particles usually have some form of motion. This motion accounts for the 'heat' of the particles, e.g. in high temperatures particles would move faster than if they were at lower temperatures, assume the particles remain the same element. \n\nThe idea of absolute zero is that, theoretically, even though substances can be gasses, there exists a state where all particles of matter become motionless. They would be much like a solid (at that temperature they pretty much are), but there would be no lattices or bonds between separate particles.\n\n**This also means that ideal gasses at absolute zero have no volume**. Emphasis on ideal, as the concept of an ideal gas revolves around the idea that their particles have negligible volume, and are not affected by attraction/repulsion. \n\nThus, ideal gasses at absolute zero have no kinetic energy, and no volume.\n```\n\nNote: Temperature(kelvin) = Temperature(degrees celcius) + 273.15\n\nTo measure some molar amount of a gas, given that volume is influenced by both temperature and pressure, we have to use some constant of both temperature and pressure.\n\nIUPAC (big science people) recommends the **standard temperature and pressure** (STP). \n\nThis describes gasses at 273.15 K or 0$\\degree C$, and at a pressure of 100 kPa.\n\nGiven a gas at STP,\n\n**One mole -\u003e 22.71 L**\n\nThis applies **regardless** of the type of gas, except it only applies for gasses at STP.\n\nThus, we have a new formula:\n\n```ad-info\n$n=\\frac{V_{stp}}{22.71}$\n```\n\nwhere n = number of moles (mol)\nV = Volume of gas at STP (L)\n\nCongratulations! Now you can convert for grams to moles, moles to grams, litres to moles, and moles to litres.\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.543775327Z","tags":null},"/Chemistry-Things-To-Do":{"title":"","content":"*Date: 2022 05 27 Time: 14:59*\n\n\nStatus: #11AECHE_PermanentNotes \n\nTags: \n\n\n# Chemistry Things To Do\n\n\n1.

In TLC, the glass plate does not bend, and thus you will have better results.\n- Capillary action still draws the solvent up the matrix; however while the molecules in paper chromatography are separated based on mass, in TLC, separation often depends upon solubility or charge, due to the interaction of solute and matrix.\n- A dry sample is placed in the silica gel matrix. As the solvent front moves up the gel, it dissolves the sample and caries it up the matrix with it.\n- Some of the particles in the sample stick more strongly to he silica gel than others, so they lag behind the solvent\n- Eventually the different substances in the sample separate out, with similar molecules travelling a similar distance.\n\n**Gas Chromatography:**\n- Used for identifying substances and their concentrations in stable mixtures (ones that do not decompose)\n\t- Mobile phase: **inert carrier gas**\n\t\t- Helium\n\t\t- Nitrogen\n\t\t- Hydrogen\n\t- Stationary phase: **High BP viscous liquid** (that stays liquid(non-volatile))\n- Retention **time** is based on **volatility** of **analytes** in the mixture.\n\t- More volatile analytes prefer to remain as gas (vapour), and thus are carried by the carrier gas and leave the chromatography chamber easily.\n\t- The opposite applies for less volatile analytes\n\t- Note that **volatility** is highly related to **boiling-point**, which is in turn related to **intermolecular forces**.\n\t\t- **Stronger** **intermolecular forces** leads to a **higher** **boiling point**.

State the problem\n**Description**\n- The core idea of the program is a voice assistant targeted for high-school students as a useful tool in managing and optimising their work/study life on the computer.\n- I've titled the program **Ed's Voice Assistant**, as it is a voice assistant made by me.\n- The program is a personal tool app. It is not designed to be used for educational purposes, and while it caters for improving the education quality of high-school students, it does not directly provide education. It may also be considered an entertainment app, but its primary focus is as a digital tool to improve a user's interaction with their computer.\n- Once initialized, the voice assistant will listen to the user and execute a range of functions, such as opening Firefox, opening Obsidian (note-taking app), etc. There is also some quality-of-life functions for the program, such as closing the program.\n- As stated before, the target audience is students, as I feel that most students could use a voice assistant in terms of managing and further optimizing their computer usage, aiming predominantly for greater ease of use. \n- I aim to create a voice assistant that will allow increased productivity when using their computer for study or work. The target audience, myself included, wish to increase their personal productivity when studying, by eliminating repetition and tediousness that occurs regularly. \n\t- For example, when I am studying chemistry, I open Firefox, Obsidian and OneNote, and open textbooks I have on my computer. This takes valuable time, and reduces my overall efficiency when studying. I plan for my voice assistant to remove this inefficiency, by allowing custom commands, where if I were to say a key phrase, it would do all of these things at once, saving me crucial time.\n\t- In the future, I also plan for the voice assistant to be a general tool in the office, for example it could send emails to large batches of fellow colleagues. \n\t- Furthermore, people who have used voice assistants before may demand high quality in graphical design of the program. Using Tkinter, I plan to provide a well-thought-out visual interface, however I have used copyrighted images (Siri logo) for parts of the visual design, as I feel its simplistic design fits my program.\n- The program will fill its user's need for a simplistic, easy-to-learn voice assistant that will improve their productivity. It will also improve their quality of life, by helping its users achieve a healthy study schedule/routine.\n- Having research many software licences, I have settled on using the MIT licence for my program. I believe this licence reflects my desires for the use of my program, as I hope that others can take the program and improve on it for their own use. I also believe that if their version of my voice assistant is both unique and helpful for others, that its developers should be able to relicense it.\n\n**Licencing**\nCurrently, there are 3 main software licences used by companies across the world:\n- *Permissive*\n\t- **Examples:**\n\t\t- BSD licences (family)\n\t\t- MIT Licence\n\t\t- Apache Licence\n\t\t- ISC Licence\n\t\t- JSON Licence\n\t- It is a kind of free-software licence, which means it is allows users to run the program the licence is attached to, analyse the code of the program, and most importantly redistribute modified version of the program under whatever licence fits. This essentially allows developers to configure a program how they see fit, and release their new program under a new licence.\n\t- Permissive licences are also very compatible with other licences, due to its minimal restrictions on the user.\n\t- *It should be noted that a crucial flaw with Permissive licences is that they do not guarantee the type of licence of derivative software, and thus can result in derivate programs that are not free or publicly available.*\n\t- There are a few requirements for users of a program under a permissive licence, if they wish to redistribute the software:\n\t\t- They must leave in the original copyright notice.\n\t\t- They must essentially retain the same style of licence as the original program. \n\t\t\t- Essentially, any new software created from the initial software are as open-source as the original program.\n\t\t- They must leave the initial licence text of the program, such as the one shown below:\n```yaml {title=\"MIT License text\"}\n\n_Begin license text._\n\n---\n\nCopyright \u003cYEAR\u003e \u003cCOPYRIGHT HOLDER\u003e\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

However, Copyleft licences are still considered relatively open-source, as like Permissive licences, they grant many user freedoms, such as:\n\t\t- Right to perform/display, i.e. the right to use/display the program in public\n\t\t- Right to modify\n\t\t- Right to distribute\n\t- However, compared to Permissive licences, Copyleft licences do not allow users intending to redistribute modified software to include sublicences. In general, Copyleft licences also stipulate that redistributed version of software must keep the source code available to recipients of the new software. Furthermore, any derivative version must have the same licence as the initial software.\n\t- **The core difference between Copyleft and Permissive licences is that Copyleft licences require that any derivate programs contain the same licence.**\n- *Commercial/Proprietary*\n\t- **Examples**\n\t\t- There are no examples of public licence for Proprietary and Commercial software, as in general companies create specific legal agreements between them and users.\n\t- Proprietary/Commercial licences are some of the most restrictive licences available for software.  Minimal amounts of users are usually given, such as rights to use and display the program. However, the use of software under Proprietary or Commercial licences are usually highly restrictive.\n\t\t- For example, Adobe licences used to be limited to one users, i.e. they could only be used on one computer at a time.\n\t- Commercial and Proprietary licences are generally considered *closed-source*, as most Proprietary and Commercial programs are distributed in their **compiled form**, compared to **source code**.\n\t- In general, Commercial and Proprietary licences also heavily restrict the redistribution of software. Where source code is available, some Proprietary and Commercial licences also restrict the distribution of modified source code.\n\n**Resources:**\nThe program is Python based, and relies on text files to store data. The program also requires a lot of module for its basic function.\n\n**Modules:**\n| Module Name        | Purpose                       | Importance          |\n| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |\n| tkinter            | GUI Design                    | Essential           |\n| pyttsx3            | Outputting voice              | Essential           |\n| speech_recognition | Recognising user input        | Essential           |\n| PIL                | Getting images                | Moderate Importance |\n| atexit             | Running code when script ends | Moderate Importance |\n| fileinput          | Closing text files            | Low Importance      |\n| sys                | Debugging in console          | Low Importance      |\n| time               | Getting time for the user log | Low Importance                    |\n\n\n**Similar Products:**\n- Alexa\n\t- Amazon's Alexa excels in its compatibility with many operating systems, such iOS and Android. It also has numerous unique commands, and even includes voice commands that can change settings. I have considered using voice-activated commands to change settings, but I feel there is simply not enough settings to change, and it would be redundant. Furthermore, as the program is a python file, it is generally incompatible with most computers, considering the amount of modules it relies on.\n- Google Assistant\n\t- Google Assistant's greatest quality is its voice recognition software, which is some of the best in the world. However, through Google's text-to-speech module in Python, my voice assistant should have the same recognition capabilities. Stylistically, Google Assistant has a simplistic, colourful design, which I have been inspired by. The design of Google's voice assistant focuses on user interaction, in its friendly voice and extensive utility as a general assistant. I am able to use Google's text-to-speech via its Python module\n- Siri\n\t- Apple's Siri is a very versatile voice assistant. It has limited settings, and is not very compatible compared to other well-known voice assistants. However, in terms of languages available, Siri is quite compatible, supporting up to 21 languages as of April 2021. Siri is mostly designed for mobile uses, which is why it is the most popular voice assistant for mobile devices. Unfortunately, as my program is written primarily in Python, and requires a lot of Python modules, it is incompatible for mobile use. However, I hope to design a voice assistant with much more basic voice commands than Siri, and my idea of customised voice commands give my program an advantage over Siri.\n2.

Couldn't wait a week to write another one of these. Just wanted to say that hopefully all images should be working right now, thanks to some epic javascript by Osacr, who is a member of the notes coalition. I will start begging Osacr to help with highlights, but in the mean time I probably won't be working on this project excessively. I'm not abandoning it though. Don't worry.\n\n\n### 27/08/2022\n\nSo it turns out that my formula for note taking isn't the slightest bit helpful because there aren't exactly clear links to stuff yet... Well I plan to fix this via republishing my Obsidian vault to Github (yes it was up in the first place), but I haven't gotten around to purging the vault of some personal stuff. \n\nNormally, this would be fine, but because people like Tag exist and Tag likes to take other people's notes without asking them, I've had to private the repository. Give me a few days and it'll be back soon. :)\n\n\n\n/\\\\ Proof that I am not capping and the repo exists.

But, some equations don’t really have simple gradients like linear equations.\n\n\u003e $y=mx +c$ , where m is the gradient\n\nInstead, lets look at the equation $y = x^2$:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://edsobsidiannotes.netlify.app/assets/Pasted image 20220422210133.png\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"\u003e\n\nLooking at points 0 to 1, the y values increase by 1 (1 – 0). However, from 1 to 2 it increases by 3 (4-1). This means we cannot use a simple number to describe the gradient of this function.\n\nNow, let’s look at the function where x = 1. We’re looking for the gradient of this point, and:\n\n$Gradient = \\frac{Rise}{Run}$\n\nBut to use that equation, we need 2 points.\n\nLet’s choose point (4,2).\n\nThe gradient using this point is: $\\frac{4-1}{2-1}$ = 3.\n\nThat’s good, but this point is really far away (relatively). If we’re looking for the gradient at a **particular point,** the closer we are to the point the better.\n\nWhat about (1.05, 1.1025)?\n\nThe gradient then becomes 2.05.\n\nThat’s very close to 2, but we can’t exactly infer right now. What about (1.001, 1.002001)?\n\nThe gradient is now 2.001.\n\nWell, it looks pretty clear that the gradient at 1 is 2.\n\nHow would we describe this using fancy words?\n\nLet’s say P is (1, 1), and Q is some point on this function.\n\nWe’d say that the **limit** of the gradient of the line (or chord) PQ (now we’re treating this line as a linear equation), as Q approaches P, appears to be 2.\n\nWe call this gradient the **instantaneous rate of change**. (instantaneous meaning within a certain instance, rate of change being another word for gradient)\n\nGreat, we’ve stated that the gradient of a certain point is two. But wait a second. How can a point have a gradient, if it’s a stationary point?\n\nWell, it can’t. But think of it like this.\n\nImagine we have a graph of a car’s distance travelled. The gradient of a point is essentially the velocity of this car. Velocity will increase when the distance function is steeper.\n\nBut, if we were to take a picture of the car in motion, then how could you tell that its moving?\n\nYou couldn’t with one image of the car, but with 2 at certain points, so you could compare the distance and time taken.\n\nThis makes it weird to think about velocity as a graph. If we were to isolate a single point on this graph of velocity, it wouldn’t make much sense because to compute velocity we need multiple points.\n\nNow, let’s think about the speedometer of the car as it travels. Perhaps the speedometer is measuring a small amount of time, analysing the difference in distance the car travels between 20 and 20.0001 seconds into its journey.\n\nTherefore, in the real world, this paradox of **instantaneous** rates of change is circumvented, by using a roughly similar approach that we used for the $y=x^2$ problem.\n\nThus, we should think of this rate of change not as **instantaneous,** but measuring a rate of change **over a _very_ small time**.\n\nNow, lets look at the $y=x^2$ problem again.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://edsobsidiannotes.netlify.app/assets/nice triangle.png\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"\u003e\n\nLets say the black and blue lines represent a **really** small change in value. In this case, we'll let the length of the black lines = h (run), and we'll think about the blue lines later.\n\nWe'll say the bottom left point (indicated as 1,1) is actually x, just the x in $f(x)$, an x value on the x axis. That means the bottom right point is x + h.\n\nThe point at the very top of this triangle is $f(x+h)$, where $f(x)=x^2$. This is because $f(x)$ is the output when given x, the x value in this case is x + h.\n\nThe blue line would be equal to the value of the point at the top, minus the value of $f(x)$, or the point that we’re basing this off. i.e. The top right point minus the bottom left point. This makes the **rise** of the gradient $f(x+h) - f(x)$. (the difference between the 2 points)\n\nNow, the gradient formula is $\\frac{Rise}{Run}$. Remember the run is the black line, which is essentially h. Therefore, The gradient of these points that we’re chosen is:\n\n$\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$\n\nRemember that h is just some arbitrary value that we're adding to a point (variable) to create 2 points.\n\nNow, we’ve said before that as the distance between these two points (on the x axis), we get closer to the gradient of the point.\n\nLikewise, we describe this as a **limit**, where something approaches zero (in this case), which would be the distance between the two points.\n\nNow, we can write the formula as:\n\n$\\displaystyle \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$\n\nDoes this work with our function, $f(x)=x^2$?\n\nLet’s substitute our function into this formula.\n\n$\\displaystyle \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{x^2+2hx+h^2-x^2}{h}$\n\n$\\displaystyle \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{2hx+h^2}{h}$\n\n$\\displaystyle \\lim_{h \\to 0} 2x+h$\n\nNow, at this point you may realise something from chapter 3 of Sadler 1. If h is approaching 0, doesn’t that mean we can’t divide it?\n\nWell, yes but that’s exactly why we use limits in the first place! It essentially allows us to choose when to actually acknowledge that h = 0.\n\nJust kidding. Remember, we’re still looking for the rate of change **over a small time**. h may approach 0, but by definition of limits (dont search that up), It’s not exactly 0 until we need it to.\n\nSo, since $h \\to 0$, $(2x+h) \\to 2x$, where h becomes 0.\n\nThus, instead of keeping the h part, we just state the gradient without the h.\n\nKnowing that the “gradient” of the graph $y=x^2$ is $2x$, does this follow what we’ve found out before?\n\nWell, what about the point (1,1)? Well, the x in the gradient equation is equal to the x in the function (and the point), so:\n\nAt the point (1,1),\n\nGradient $= 2 \\times 1$\n\t\t\t\t  $= 2$\n\nJust as we’ve found before!","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.543775327Z","tags":null},"/Econ-Class-1":{"title":"","content":"\n# Econ Class 1\n\n\n**Supply and demand mainly affects global prices** and *not* the *price of its components*\n\ne.g. oil price dropped, but petrol price is still high\n\tdue to demand for petrol\n\tcost is related to cost for refining oil made months ago, that was more expensive\n\nTrade is how we achieve economic growth\n- side-effect: also comes with standard of living\n- free markets :)\n\n```ad-note\n\nIn economics you should:\n- adopt different perspectives when analysing situations\n- evaluate the benefits and costs of individual and social choices\n- examine and understand how certain events and issues are related\n```\n\n**Economics is:**\n- \"*A study of human behaviour as a relationship between ends(final products which we want) and scarce means which have alternative uses.*\"\n\n**Scarcity is important**\n- **Relative** scarcity in particular\n- Things are scarce but only **relative** to what we want to use them for\n- \"The study of how men allocate their scarce resources to provide for their wants.\" (J Harvey)\n**Scarcity:** *Insufficient resources available (limited resources) to produce all that people desire (unlimited wants)*\n\n**Two main branches of economics:**\n- **Microeconomics**\n- **Macroeconomics (what we do now)**\n\nThe **Basic Economic Problem** (BEP) \n- Insufficient resources available (limited resources) to produce all that people desire (unlimited wants)\n- **Additionally**, resources have *alternative uses*\n\n**Relative scarcity: based on relationship between wants and resources**\n\n```ad-important\n\n**Resources are scarce relative to the demand for goods and services**\n```\n- Relative scarcity means that we **do not have enough resources** to *satisfy all our wants and needs*.\n- Are there goods that have no cost? **No!**\n- What are examples of free goods? **There are none!**\n- **Free goods** are goods which have **no** **price**, **no** **property price**, and require **no** **factors of production for enjoyment**.\n- NO goods are free (except things like air/sunshine)\n- *All goods* have an **economic** **cost**.\n- Due to scarcity, people are **forced** **to make choices**.\n\t- Examples include:\n\t\t- Wood is scarce.

When available resources are scarce, producers may prioritize products that can be most efficiently made with their limited resources.\n\tc. in a weak local economy, consumers may produce cheaper products in greater qualities, so that their products become more affordable.\n\t5. Products that require intense labour tend to incur greater labour costs, so producers may opt to produce products that involve less labour.\n\t6. The Japanese economy is more service-centred, and also focuses on industries that do not require common natural resources, or wholly depend on imports (such as technology).\n\t7. China has an abundance of cheap labour and natural resources. This allows manufacturing costs to be cheap, as its abundance in labour and natural resources decreases the overall costs for production.

In order to increase funding for the war in Iraq, and to cut taxes for the rich, Bush would have to take money from the U.S. budget. This means that other sectors of the budget would not get money, such as infrastructure, education and healthcare.\n\t11. Labour-intensive refers to industries that rely on labour to produce goods. Capital-intensive refers to industries that rely on heavy machinery or capital investments to produce goods. Examples of labour-intensive industries include clothing, and accounting. Examples of capital-intensive industries include microchips and car manufacturing.\n\t12. Consumers' demand for a certain product will influence its value, as low demand results in consumers being less likely to pay high prices. This leads to consumers producing less of the product. For example, if it is revealed that coffee is extremely dangerous, then people are less likely to buy coffee, reducing demand, and subsequently the cost will increase. Furthermore, if coffee was revealed to be extremely healthy, people would buy more of it, and the demand would increase, increasing the price as producers increase production.\n\t13. The government may use their budget to purchase from specific industries, increasing the demand and value of said industries. For example, if the government were to invest in more mining sites, this would increase the amount of capital in the mining economy, allowing the potential for greater demand.\n\t14. The financial cost of a desalination plant would be the actual capital cost to build and maintain a desalination plant.

(**Net exports = exports - imports**)\n\t- Total **output** in an economy.\n\t- *What happens when aggregate demand is greater or lower than aggregate supply?*\n\t- Components of aggregate demand:\n\t\t- Consumption Expenditure - Consumption\n\t\t\t- Spending by **consumers - every person in economy, including firms, government, etc.**\n\t\t\t- Durable goods, e.g. houses\n\t\t\t- Non-durable goods, *lasts 3 years or less* e.g. perishable food\n\t\t\t- Services, e.g. education\n\t\t\t- 60% of aggregate demand.\n\t\t- Investment Expenditure\n\t\t\t- Spending on capital, e.g. machinery, **factories** and anything that can produce thing, which will produce goods and services in the future.\n\t\t\t- Refers to business and housing investment or inventories\n\t\t- Government Expenditure\n\t\t\t- G1: current (consumption) expenditure which are part of the day to day functions of government.\n\t\t\t\t- This refers to the set budget for the upkeep of the services/goods it provides.\n\t\t\t\t- e.g. There is a daily payment to the school for it to continue its servicing of education.\n\t\t\t\t- This usually cannot be changed.\n\t\t\t- G2: capital (investment) expenditure to provide for future needs such as schools, roads, etc.\n\t\t\t\t- Government invests money into improving existing goods/services or providing new things.\n\nFiscal policy is when government changes G2 to boost or lower economic activity. G1 is essentially constant.\n\n**Aggregate Demand curve: how to change it**\n- Taxation - income changes, changing consumption\n- Interest Rates\n- Changes in supply\n- Deregulation?\n- Government spending\n- Immigration\n- Trade policy\n- Wage changes\n- Everything here is something to do with consumption, investment or government.\n- This is because anything that changes these things change aggregate demand\n- To move the curve, we must change these factors.\n\n**What is aggregate supply?**\n- The **total** amount of goods and services produced in an economy at a given price level over a given period of time. It is essentially the sum of all the supply curves of individual producers\n- This is exactly the same as GDP, as GDP measures value of output, which is essentially the same\n- We strive to be at equilibrium, where **aggregate supply** = **aggregate demand**\n\t- It's not bad or good, its simply when the 2 things are equal.\n\t- You can have equilibrium in both depression and boom.\n- An economy will never be at equilibrium, as there are too many everchanging factors.\n- However, our economy is trying to be at equilibrium.\n- Currently, aggregate demand is exceeding aggregate supply.\n\t- This means the producers cannot produce everything that people want.\n\t- This causes the price of the products to increase.\n\t- As the **price level** rises, demand will decrease as *people cannot afford it*. This is called the **income effect**.\n\t- Eventually, through price levels, we reach a point of \"equilibrium\" in a sense where aggregate demand reduces to the point where it meets aggregate supply.\n\t- The opposite applies, when we increase supply of a goods to match aggregate demand, prices will fall as we reach a point where aggregate demand reach a point.\n\t- **TLDR; Markets always move towards equilibrium, but will never get there due to imbalance between aggregate demand and supply.**\n\n- *Aggregate Supply curve* is the relationship between aggregate supply and the general price level.\n- Aggregate supply is total amount of goods/services produced, but does that mean the economy is at full capacity?\n- No! This is why the aggregate supply curve exists, the change in aggregate supply represents capacity utilization.\n\nNote: when supply curve moves to left, this is called a **supply shock**.\n- Increasing capacity translates curve to right, decreasing capacity translate curve to left.\n\n==Fiscal policy is **demand-side**!!!==\n\n***Aggregate supply can increase, but it does so if:***\n- Labour or capital increases\n- New technologies are adopted\n- Productivity increases\n- Price for key natural resources falls =\u003e This is a massive issue, and usually causes supply shocks.\n- Wage expectations fall\n\t- It will shift left if a supply shock occurs.\n\nFiscal policy's purpose is to maintain stability in an economy via impacting economic activity, and to meet the government objectives.\n\n### Fiscal Policy (finally)\nThe purpose of fiscal policy is to affect the level of economic activity, and meet the government's economic projections/objectives.\n- It also aims to affect resource allocation and income distribution.\n\n**Budget**: statement of *expected* revenue and *expected* expenditure over the financial year.\n\nWhen budget is written, the parts for G1 things are pretty accurate, as they have good enough data on the things already.

It is essentially impossible to have everyone employed, so RBA works towards the unemployment target of 4-5%.\n- Economic prosperity and welfare\n\t- This objective relates to the Reserve Bank promoting an environment that supports the economic prosperity and welfare of the Australian people.\n\t- This is primarily achieved by maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment\n\n### Transparency:\n- The RBA's decisions about monetary policy are expressed publicly, to ensure accountability. \n\t- It gives the business community **confidence**, and allows them to make informed decisions on their business actions.\n\t- It gives consumers confidence, as consumers can plan for things, e.g. cash rate changes.\n\n### Types of Monetary Policy\n- Expansionary\n\t- Trying to *expand the economy*.

RBA changes cash rate. Usually by half a percent. Sometimes by a full percent. For example, if we want contractionary policy, we will increase the cash rate.\n2. Transmission Channel No 1: Consumers *must borrow money*, to buy big-ticket items. When cash rates increases, people are less incentivised to buy things, e.g. houses. This reduces demand for item, meaning their prices fall. Thus, Channel No 1 is the **consumption channel**, and its really important as this *influences consumers*. If demand for a product increases too much, increasing the cash rate decreases the demand for this product. Furthermore, for houses, decreasing demand results in **reduced labour**. Thus, the consumption channel can have a **big impact**.

This\n\nThe initial drop in cash rate was a direct response to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused stagnation in the macroeconomy. However, as lockdowns ended and economic activity skyrocketed, numerous crises such as the cost of living crisis and the housing crisis required the RBA to increase interest rates, and reduce aggregate demand. In doing so, the RBA engaged in contractionary policy to keep inflation low. This was done to keep inflation rate low, and eventually reach a 2-3% range.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.543775327Z","tags":null},"/Econ-Class-2":{"title":"","content":"\t\n# Econ Class 2\n\n### Adam Smith:\n- **Came up with the idea of the ==free markets==**\n\t- Freedom to produce and exchange goods and minimising the role of government interventions and taxations in the free market (he did see the government as responsible for the **education** and **defence sectors** of the country)\n- The **\"invisible hand\"** : forces of supply and demand, every person helps to create the best outcome for all. - looked at concept of supply and demand, said price would determine the output - supply and demand lead to best output\n\t- **invisible hand**: ==market determines outcome, with no government interference.==\n- **Gross Domestic Product**: before smith, wealth of nation was based **on gold**.

Furthermore, inventions supported trade (steam engine, cotton loom etc.)\n\t- The British **created a competitive advantage**.\n- **Biggest contribution** was **trade**.\n\t- Came up with theory of **competitive advantage**\n\t\t- Understood that nations use resources **differently**.\n\t\t- Nations with same resources may produce a certain product with a lower **efficiency**\n\t\t- Nations/businesses should **specialise** in goods they produce **efficiently** and **trade** with nations that produce things that they **produce inefficiently**.\n\t\t- Countries can benefit from international trade by specialising in the production of goods for which they have a relatively lower **opportunity costs** even if they do not have an **absolute advantage.**\n```ad-note\ntitle: Definition\n**Absolute advantage:** The ability for an entity to produce more of a good or a service than a competitor (assuming same resources+tech)\n```\n```ad-note\ntitle: Definition\n**Competitive advantage:** The ability for an entity to produce a good or service at a *lower opporunity cost* than a competitor\n\n```\n```ad-note\ntitle: Definition\n**Opportunity cost**: The real cost of the next best alternative (in the scale of preference) that is forgone in order to obtain more of something else.\n```\n- **Secondly, the Labour theory of value**.\n\t- Value (*price?*) of good should not be based on the compensation paid for labour, but on the total cost of production.\n- **Corn Laws (1815-1846)**:\n\t- Tariffs and other trade restrictions on imported food and corn enforced in the UK.\n\t- Keep corn prices high to **favour domestic producers** and represent **British mercantilism**\n\t- Tariffs work to promote domestic production.\n\t\t- e.g. Lets say a car cost $2000 if produced in Australia, but $1900 if it was imported. Tariffs increase the cost of imports by imposing a tax. This would make the cost of the imported car relatively high, say $2100. Then, the domestically produced car would be move favourable, but at an expense to the consumer, as the prices actually go up.\n\t- The great famine forced a resolution, and the laws were repealed, as buying food for cheap in the global market is better than growing it yourself at a higher cost.\n\n### Robert Malthus (pretty irrelevant guy):\n- First idea in essay, \"an essay on the principle of production\"\n\t- Population would continue expanding until growth is stopped or reversed by disease, famine, war or calamity\n\t- Population growth will always tend to outrun the food supply that betterment of human and land is impossible without strict limits on reproduction\n- Idea debunked, we have an abundance of food thanks to technology, however food transportation leads to famine, as it costs too much to feed people across the world.\n- Context: Poor laws\n\t- Ensure people have access to **food**, **clothing** and **shelter**. But they had to work for it. However, population exploded.\n\t- Laws maintained from 16th century till after ww2.\n- The Malthusian theory of population made a strong and immediate impact on British social policy. It had been believed that fertility itself added to national wealth; the Poor Laws perhaps encouraged large families with their doles. \n\n### Karl Marx:\n- German economist\n- Most prevalent idea was \"the ==communist Manifesto==\" (1848)\n\t- Focused on the struggle between capitalists (owners of productive resources/factories etc.) and the working class. (**still ongoing today**)\n\t- Examines the effect of capitalism on labour, productivity and economic development and argues for a worker revolution to overturn capitalism in favour of communism. He felt this because there was a disproportionate number of capitalists to working class\n\t- Labourers: have **little power** in the capitalist economic system\n\t\t- Also exploited with **low wages**(**modern issue**) to maximise in profit\n\t- Communism as an economic concept:\n\t\t- Workers should become owners of factories and production. Workers have equal share in ownership of factory. This gives incentive to produce goods as best as possible, as they have a share in the profits. \n\n### John Maynard Keynes\n- British, came up with his idea in 1936 about ==economic intervention policies (government expenditure)==\n- Prominent economist during the great depression, believed government intervention could save the global economy\n- Macroeconomic theory of total spending in the economy and its effect on output, employment and inflation:\n\t- **Described GDP as c + i + g**\n\t\t- Before it was c + i, **consumption and investment**, now with g, **government spending**\n\t\t- At this time, there was great depression, but Keynes believed that the government could **spend** to combat **depression**.\n- Advocates for increased **government expenditure** and **lower taxes** to stimulate demand and **pull the global economy out of the depression**\n- Government investment can stimulate the private sector of an economy.\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.543775327Z","tags":null},"/Econ-Class-3":{"title":"","content":"\n# Econ Class 3\n\n### John Maynard Keynes\n- Big thing was **government expenditure concept** - government should stimulate and invest in the economy\n- Believed only way out of the great depression was government expenditure.\n\n### Milton Friedman\n- American economist in 1962\n- Hated government interference\n- 1962 \"capitalism and freedom\" - **monetarism**\n\t- importance of monetary policy - control of the money supply in the economy by government controlling the supply of money that flows in the economy while allowing the rest of the market to fix itself (**promotes free market**)\n\t- supply should grow at nice consistent rate *(roughly 3 percent)*, then economy will grow at same rate.

Friedman was about human incentives, prices, inflations. He wanted free market. He was big on governments not interfering.** -\u003e much like Smith\n\t- Friedman brought about a renewed emphasis on prices, inflation and human incentives, a direct counter to Keynes' focus on employment, interest and public policy.\n- To change individual consumption, **income must change** \n- Friedman's first big breakthrough in the field of economics was his Theory of the Consumption Function in 1957, which championed the idea that a person's consumption and savings decisions are more greatly impacted by permanent changes to income, rather than changes to income that are perceived as temporary. This theory produced the permanent income hypothesis which explained why short-term tax increases actually decrease savings and keep consumption levels static, all else being equal, (That is, people will draw down on their savings to maintain the level of consumption if taxes are increased).\n- If short term tax increase, people will **draw down on savings** to **maintain level of consumption**, *rather than reduce* level of consumption.\n- **Permanent** tax increases **will affect** level of consumption\n- Inflation is a monetary phenomenon. It is driven by **too much money**.\n\u003eThe most famous excerpt from Friedman's writings and speeches is, \"Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.\" He defied the intellectual climate of his era and reasserted the quantity theory of money as a viable economic tenet. In a 1956 paper titled \"Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money,\" Friedman found that, in the long run, increased monetary growth increases prices but does not really affect output.\n- Friedman's work busted the classic Keynesian dichotomy on inflation, which asserted that prices rose from either ”cost-push” or “demand-pull” sources. It also put monetary policy on the same level as fiscal policy.\n- **Both Keynes and Friedman are correct. Print money -\u003e inflationary pressures, while too much demand compared to supply also causes inflation.**\n\n### Fredrich von Wieser\n- Came up with marginal utility, and opportunity cost.\n- Cost of a commodity depends neither on the amount of money nor the amount of labour required in its production but rather on its subjective or psychological value.\n- Furthermore, Wieser contributed the theory of \"**impution**\", and thought what price actually means.\n\t- Price tells you the value of the commodity **relative to other goods and relative to your *demand for it***\n\t- Price has to some degree represents cost, however they also represent **market conditions** - how many people want the product, and how much of the product is available (supply and demand), relative to other products and their supply/demand.\n- Said a **socialist economy** would also require a **price system**.\n- Thought about scarcity, resource allocation and marginal utility.\n\t- Prices reflect what people want and how much satisfaction you get from them.\n### Fredrich von Hayek\n- Big on free market, contradicting Keynes\n- Believed prices of free market was greater indicator of what happens in the market.\n\n### **Thinkers in the Assessment**:\n- Adam Smith\n- David Ricardo\n- Keynes\n- Friedman\n- Karl Marx\n- **NOT** Wieser\n- **NOT** Hayek\n\n\n## Economic Systems\n- Milton Friedman was dealing with inflation, and how to get out of it\n- Keynes was dealing with great depression\n- Keynes/Smith was about indivudal revolution, and free market\n- Karl Marx was reacting to exploitation of workers\n- ALL concerned with how a system works, how its resources are divided\n\n==Philosophers:\nQ1: What they Do:\nQ2: Their contribution to a system\nQ3: Tie it together==\n\n- What is an economic system?\n\t- Refers to the way an economy organises itself to address the Basic Economic problem.\n4 questions for BEP:\n- **What to produce**\n- **How to produce**\n- **How much to produce**\n- **For whom to produce**\n\nHence government control used to solve the BEP depends on the type of economic system:\n- Free market\n- Planned (command)\n- Mixed (modified market)\n- Tradition (cringe and not relevant)\n*Smith - free market, Marx - planned, Keynes - mixed*\n\nMost economies require **a system** to address the 4 basic questions\n- A system where all the decisions are made by the government OR where markets are allowed to make decisions\n- Mixed is a little bit of both.\n\n- A decision made in the city can have a massive environmental impact on rural areas -\u003e Great famine, sparrow stuff\n\n- An economic ystem refers to the way an economy organises itself to address the BEP\n- An economic system is a system of production, resource allocation and distribution of goods and services within a society or a given geographic area.\n- It includes the combination of the various institutions, agencies, entities, decision-making processes and patterns of consumption that comprise the economic structure of a given community/society/country.\n==KEY CONCEPT OF A MARKET ECONOMY IS THE LAWS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND==\n\n- A market economy is a system where the **laws of supply and demand** *direct* the production of goods and services\n- Supplies includes natural resources, land, labour and enterprie - Factors of Production\n- Demands include purchases by consumers, business and the government.\n- Businesses sell their wares at the highest price consumers will pay.\n- At the same time, shoppers **look for the lowest prices** for the goods and services they want.\n- Workers bid their services at the highest possible wages that their skills allow. \n- Employers seek to get the best employees at the **lowest possible price**\n- Equilibrium when what they are willing to sell is the same as when you are willing to buy\n- Unions are a response to when an individual has to negotiate with larger company. It allows people to control wages of a specific job and where competition can work together to advocate for better wages.\n\n**Market Economy characteristics:**\n- Private Property\n\t- One of the most important characteristics of a market economy\n\t- Most goods and services are privately owned\n\t- The owners can make legally-binding contracts to buy, sell or lease their property.\n\t- In other words, their assets give them the right to profit from ownership.\n\t- Important because gives **sense of security, and has the financial motivation to improve and increase efficiency of a property.** \n- Freedom of choice\n\t- You decide what you buy, sell and produce.\n\t- Most importantly, you operate in a **competitive market**.\n\t- There are 2 constrains:\n\t\t- First is the price at which they are willing to buy or sell. In truly competitive markets, the market will determine the price. You can't choose, or else you will not profit\n\t\t- Second is the amount of capital they have.\n\t- Motive of Self-Interest\n\t\t- People are driven by self-interest, want to sell products to highest bidder, and want to negotiate to buy things at the lower price.\n\t\t- This will lead to benefit for the economy in the long term.\n\t\t- Auction system sets prices for goods and services that reflect their market value.\n\t\t- It gives an **accurate picture of supply and demand at any given moment.**\n\t- Competition\n\t\t- MUST have competition in a market place.\n\t\t- **The force of competitive pressure keeps prices low. It also ensures that society provides goods and services most efficiency.**\n\t\t\t- When in competition, people work to be the best for the consumers.\n\t\t- As soon as demand increases for a particular item, prices rise thanks to the law of demand.\n\t\t- Competitors see they can enhance their profits by producing it, adding to supply.\n\t\t- This lowers prices to a level where only the best competitors.\n\t- System of Markets and Prices\n\t\t- A market economy relies on an efficient market in which to sell goods and market\n\t\t\t- This is realistically not true.\n\t\t- That's where all the buyers and sellers have equal access to the same information.\n\t\t- Price changes are pure reflections of the laws of supply and demand.\n\t- **Limited** government\n\t\t- The role of government is to ensure that the markets are open and working.\n\t\t- For example, it is in charge of national defence to protect the markets. It also make sure that everyone has **equal access to the markets. The government penalizes monopolies that restrict competition.** \n\t\t- It makes sure no one is manipulating the markets and that everyone has equal access to information.\n\t\t- Government should not interfere in government, should make sure market is efficient\n\nPlanned/Command Economy:\n- When a **central government makes all economic decisions**.\n- Either the government or a collective owns the land and the means of production.\n- ***It doesn't rely on the laws of supply and demand that operate in a market economy.***\n- In recent years, many **centrally-planned economies** began adding aspect of the market economy. The resultant mixed economy better achieves their goals\n- America has been introducing **supply-side economics** (related to command?), people don't learn from mistakes\n\nWhat happens?\n- The government creates a **central economic plan setting economic and societal goals** for every sector and region of the country\n- *The government allocates all resources according to this central plan*\n- People **must** work to follow this plan.\n- **It tries to use the nation's capital, labour and natural resources in the most *efficient way possible.***\n- It promises to use each people's skills and abilities to their highest capacity seeking to eliminate unemployment.\n- 1 Positive: 0 Unemployment!!!\n\nThe central plan:\n- Sets the priorities for the production of all goods and services.\n- These include **quotas** and **price controls**. Its goal is to supply enough **food, housing and other basics** to meet the needs of everyone in the country.\n\t- In a market economy, government uses other means to influence prices compared to price controls e.g. interest rate\n- It also sets national priorities which include mobilizing for war or generating robust economic growth.\n\nGovernment:\n- **The government creates laws, regulations, and directives to enforce the central plan**\n- Businesses follow the plan's production and hiring targets.\n- They can't respond on their own to free market forces.\n- Government owns monopoly businesses. These are in industries deemed essential to the goals of the economy.\n- These usually includes finance, utilities, and automotive.\n- *There is no domestic competition in these sectors.*\n\nThe command economy is a key feature of any communist society.\n- Cuba, North Korea and the former Soviet Union are examples of countries that have command economies.\n- China maintained a command economy for decades before transitioning to a **mixed economy** that *features both communistic and capitalistic elements,*\n\nMixed economy:\n- System that combines characteristics of market, command and traditional economies. Australia is mixed.\n- It benefits from the advantages of all three while suffering from few of the disadvantages.\n\n**Will have 3 of the following charac. of a market economy:**\n- Protect private property\n- Allows the free market and the laws of supply and demand to determine prices\n- It is driven by the motivation of the self-interest of individuals\n\n**Some charac. of command economy**:\n- It allows the central government to safeguard its people and its market.\n- The government has a large role in the military, international trade and national transportation.\n\n*The government's role in other area depends on the priorities of the citizens.*\n- In some the government creates a central plan that guides the economy.\n- **Other mixed economies allow the government to own key industries.**\n- These include aerospace, energy production, and even banking.\n- *The government may also manage healthcare, welfare and retirement programs.*\n\n```ad-note\n\nAustralia is considered to be a mixed economy because it is characterised by private enterprise coupled with strong regulatory oversight by government and the government provisions of public goods such as roads.\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.543775327Z","tags":null},"/Econ-Class-4":{"title":"","content":"\n# Econ Class 4\n\n\n**Understanding Types of Economic Systems**:\n- Can government run an economy? *This is the main idea around economic systems.*\n- Economics vary when it comes to government involvement.

This system doesn't work.\n- **Efficiency** - Firms in a capitalist based society face incentives to be efficient and produce goods which are in demand. These incentives create the pressures to cut costs and avoid waste.\n\t- If not, they will lose against firms that *are*. \n- **Innovation** - With Capitalism entrepreneurs and firms are seeking to create and develop profitable products. Therefore, they will not be stagnant but invest in new products which may be popular with consumers. This can lead to product development and more choice of goods.\n- **Economic Growth** - With firms and individuals facing incentives to be innovative and work hard - creates a climate of innovation and economic expansion,\n- This helps to increase real GDP and lead to improved living standards.\n\n\tWeaknesses of Capitalism:\n- **Monopoly power** - Private ownership of capital enables firms to gain monopoly power in product and labour markets. Firms with monopoly power can exploit their positions to charge higher prices.\n- **Social benefit ignored** - A free market will ignore both positive and negative externalities. e.g. doesn't care about climate change, only profits.\n- A profit maximising capitalist firm is likely to ignore negative externalities, such as pollution from production, this can harm living standards.\n- Similarly, a free-market economy will under-provide goods with positive externalities, such as health, public transport and education.\n- This leads to an **inequitable** allocation of resources.\n- **Inherited wealth and wealth inequality** - A capitalist society is based on the legal right to private property and the ability to pass on wealth to future generations.\n- Capitalists argue that a capitalist society is fair because you gain the rewards of your hard work.\n- But, often people are rich, simply because they inherit wealth or are born into a privileged class. Therefore, capitalist society not only fails to create equality of outcome but also fails to provide equality of opportunity.\n- **Inequality creates social division** - Societies which are highly unequal create resentment and social division.\n\nCapitalism Pros:\n- Incentives to be rich, encourage innovation\n- Firms have incentives to be efficient\n- Consumers free to choose products they desire\n- Prevents large bureaucratic government\n- Better than alternatives\n\nCapitalism Cons:\n- Firms can gain monopoly power and exploit consumers\n- Firms with monopoly power can pay low wages\n- Externalities can damage the environment\n- Tends to lead to large inequality\n- Prone to 'boom and bust' economic cycles\n\n**Socialism**:\n- A political and economic theory that advocates **ownership of the means of production such as factories and farms by the people, rather than capitalists.** \n- Power is in the hands of the working class\n```ad-note\ntitle: Definition\nSocialism: Means of production are owned by the people, rather than the capitalists.\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.543775327Z","tags":null},"/Econ-Class-5":{"title":"","content":"\n# Econ Class 5\n\nStrengths of Socialism:\n- **Reduction of relative poverty** - A welfare state which provides a minimum basic income for those who are unemployed, sick or unable to work **maintains a basic living standard** for the poorest in society and helps to reduce relative poverty.\n- **\"Free\" health care** - Free health care at the point of use means everyone is entitled to basic health care. This increases the living standards of those who cannot afford to pay private doctors. By improving the nation's health it also contributes to increased labour productivity and higher economic growth in the long term.\n\t- Not actually free. Tax contributes to health care.\n\t- Compare countries? e.g. USA, Germany. In general, healthier nations are generally more productive, and will have more stable economic growth in the long run. In USA, the business cycle is more erratic. This may be because of health care\n\t- **Induced demand** - building more hospitals -\u003e people use hospital more frequently, demand is induced -\u003e more hospitals required.\n\t- *In the US, there is no universal health care and uninsured workers can slip through the net and either not be entitled to health care or go bankrupt trying to pay the bills.*\n- **In Denmark, starting pay at McDonald's is roughly $22 an hour. Workers get life insurance, maternity leave, a pension, and six weeks of paid vacation each year.**\n- **A more equal society is more *cohesive*** - A society which has equality of opportunity and limited inequality is likely to be more cohesive. If people perceive they live in a very unequal society - exploited by employers and earning significantly less than their bosses, it can lead to frustration and resentment. If everyone feels they have a fair stake in society, it can help create a more harmonious society where workers are committed to the success of the firm which they work for.\n- **Socialist values encourage selflessness rather than selfishness** - Capitalism **encourages attitude to make profit**, even at the cost of other individuals or the environment. A socialist society **does not pursue profit as its highest goal, but social cohesion and the common good**.\n- **Benefit of public ownership** - Companies can be run in the public interest rather than just for the benefit of shareholders. \n\t- For example, industries like railways and **education**\n- **Environment** - An economy which is regulated to work towards the long-term welfare will place a higher value on the environment\n\nWeaknesses of Socialism:\n- **Lack of incentives** - if an economy has **high rates** of **progressive taxation**, it could cause disincentives to work and setting up business. Entrepreneurs may feel that if the government is taking a high percentage of their profits, they would prefer not to take the risk or work abroad.\n- **Government failure** - In an ideal world, the government would be successful in regulating firms, labour markets and running public industries\n\t- However, government intervention is prone to government failure and an inefficient allocation of resources. For example, **labour market regulations such as high minimum wages could lead to unemployment and a lack of flexibility, which firms need to deal with a sudden increase in demand. If firms are highly regulated, it is an extra cost which may discourage investment and lead to lower economy growth.**\n- **Welfare state** - *it can cause disincentives* - If a welfare state is too generous, it is argued it may create a disincentive to get a job and therefore it can reduce the labour force and individual effort.\n- **Powerful unions** can cause *labour market antagonism*. ideally, socialism aims at a more harmonious society. However, if the socialist policies are geared towards strengthening trade unions and aiming for perfect inequality, it can lead to antagonistic labour relations with a \"them and us\" mentality - **workers against owners**. This attitude can *cause time lost to strike and unproductive factories.*\n\nSocialism Pros:\n- More equal society\n- Reduction of povety\n- Regulates excesses of free market - externalities, monopoly and monopsony?\n- Universal health care improves living standards and labour productivity\n- Promotes common good and social welfare rather than selfrish aims\n- More equal society increases social cohesion\n- Can promote protection of environment\n\nSocialism Cons:\n- Higher tax reduces incentives to invest and work\n- Entrepreneurs may prefer to move tax havens abroad\n- Welfare state can create disincentives to work\n- Government failure in regulation and ownership of industry\n- Excess labour market regulation can lead to less employment and structural employment\n- Powerful unions cause antagonism between workers and owners.\n\n**Communism**:\n- An economic or political system in which the **state** or the community owns all property and the means of production (literally everything), and citizens own the wealth.\n- Classless society (theoretically)\n\nStrengths of communism\n- **Centrally planned economy** - It can quickly mobilize economic resources on a large sacle, execute massive projects, and create industrial power. it can move so effectively because it overrides individual self interest and subjugates the welfare of the general population to achieve critical social goals.\n- May of the leaders are in charge for life, even through they might not hold a title from monarchy. This structure makes it easier for the leadership to transform the economic vision of the country to what the person in charge wants.\n- **Equality** - on a level that capitalism can never offer - the idea of communism is that capitalist societies will eventually crumble because the weight of wealth on top of the poor will eventually cause the system to become top heavy.\n\n```ad-important\n\n**Economics is conceptual. It's about society, and how we solve problems**\n```\n\n- **Allows for employment opportunities** - to be given out to everyone - When you live under an authentic communist government, then anyone who wants a job will have one. If you don't like the idea of working, the you must support your community in some other way.\n\nWeakenesses of communism\n- Government **owns everything** - including property, business and production means.\n\t- This **eliminates the free market from domestic society** - no laws of supply and demand to set prices that consumers play\n\t- **Price mechanism allows people to adjust price to compensate for production**\n\t- **The needs of the consumer are not really met.**\n- This causes planners to lose the feedback they need to understand what is necessary for the production cycle and what could use an upgrade. There is no up-to-date information about what the needs of the consumers happen to be either.\n- Because of this disadvantage, it is not unusual for the government to produce too much of one item and too little of another. Surpluses and shortages in critical need areas can be strong enough at times that government disruptions can occur.\n- **Central planning** - Although the government can mobilize significant resources for almost any need at a moment’s notice through the structures of communism, there is *a difference between the ability to centrally plan and its overall implementation.*\n- Because a free market doesn’t exist under this structure, the citizens will setup **black markets to help them trade the items they want** or need that are not part of the planner’s provisions.\n\t- In Soviet union, Americans would go there to sell things on the black market.\n- This disadvantage destroys the trust that is found in the pure vision of communism. The goal is to give people what they need according to who they are as individuals.\n- Communism looks at each person as a resource, provides them a common set of basic essentials, and then expects compliance under the threat of further freedom restrictions.\n- **Efficiency and productivity** are *difficult* to achieve since there is *little motive for workers.*\n- There is **never a need to have entrepreneurs** operating in a communist space because the government maintains control of everything.\n- You produce at a **specific level**.\n- That means the production cycles operate just well enough to produce what is needed for domestic consumption and **the limited export market that may be available.**\n- Because *innovation is what pushes an economy forward*, shepherded by the development made possible by *entrepreneurs* who wish to experience success, the living situation in a country practicing this form of government can be exceptionally stifling.\n- **Poverty** – There is *a reason why only five active governments* in the world today practice communism. North Korea, China, Laos, Cuba, and Vietnam are transitioning from socialism and are not true forms of this government structure any more either.\n- China is the one exception to this disadvantage because of its *efforts to integrate some elements of capitalism or free markets* into its society.\n\t- They have **used capitalism** to **pull people out of poverty**.\n- For the other five countries that continue to use this governing structure, the result is a **higher level of poverty** than other nations. North Korea, Cuba, and Laos are struggling in particular because the first emphasis is to maintain the structure of the government.

Important for test**\n```\nIn communism, the government **owns everything**. This is the most important aspect of communism. The government is also **responsible for every productive aspect it must supply (?)**\n- Government owns all means of production\n- Government owns **everything**\n- There is no concept of a **price mechanism**\n- No sense of competition, goods are allocated to individuals in society\n\t- Everyone gets the same goods\n\t- Due to no competition, quality is generally lower\n- Goal is for **equality** for everyone, as enforced by the government\n\t- This is proven to be unlikely in communist states such as the Soviet union, where corruption is rampant.\n\t- **Biggest weakness** is *inefficiency*!\nIn real world socialism, there are **degrees** of socialism.\n- What aspects of Australia are socialist? \n\t- Quite a lot. The essential human goods and services are generally owned by the government, e.g. water corporation, western power etc.\n\t\t- However, these are under State jurisdiction. So these basic means of production aren't necessarily owned by the federal government, but by the state government\n- **Basic means of production are owned and managed by the government**\n\t- In Australia, there is huge private sectors, with some regulation.\n\t- *Private ownership, with regulation, of business*\n- **Cooperation is more important than competition**\n\t- Not in Australia. Competition is important, we want lowest price with highest quality.\n- **High standard of living and economic security**\n\t- Contrasted with Socialism. In European countries (Norway), they pay a lot of tax. \n- **High taxes provide free health care and education**\n\t- Medicare is socialised healthcare. In Australia, parents pay the **medicare levy**(3% of tax. income). Government sets price for every medical procedure available in Australia. The doctor can either charge the full price, or more. If they pay more, you pay the difference, but regardless, the government will pay you what the government has stated the price is.\n\t- Public hospitals come from state, and funded by both state and federal. When you go to hospital for healthcare, most of it is usually covered through medicare. e.g. cancer, *however*, this applies to everyone.\n\t- Private hospitals cost more, however the government will pay **their share of it**. \n\t\t- Britain has the NHS. It's essentially **all public**, in private hospitals, the government doesn't pay their share. However, in the public system the government will pay for essentially all of it.\n\t- Problem: **People will use it. An overload of people will lead to problems.**\n\t\t- Private system relies on people not being able to afford it.\n\t- *Private* health insurance: \n\t\t- Say we have 1mil people in society\n\t\t- Statistically, say 1k of these people will get ill (0.1%). \n\t\t- Average cost to fix people will be $1k per person ($1mil in total)\n\t\t- How to work out premium?\n\t\t- What this means, is that people pay a health insurance premium. It's what people pay to ensure they get health insurance.\n\t\t- Say everyone pays $1 dollar. Then the insurance can pay for everyone.\n\t\t- However, if more people get sick, say 4k people get ill now, that means **everyone's** premium goes to 4 dollar, and this escalates.\n\t\t- **health insurance funds** require *healthy people* to pay into the fund and **not use it**.\n\t\t- However, young people will start dropping **out of the funds,** as they have no need for it.\n\t\t- This leads to a rapid increase in the premium. \n\t- In Australian private health insurance, they made young people at the age of 30 and beyond, they will reduce their medicare levy. \n\t- If you get private health insurance by age 30, you will get discount on medicare.\n\t\t- Get private health insurance, reduce your tax.\n\t- When thinking about socialism, consider that free stuff means that government provides it through higher taxes.\n\n**Types of Economic Systems**:\n- Adam Smith promoted Cap\n- Keynes didn't necesarily promote socialism, but believed in some aspects\n- Karl Marx really liked communism.\n\n## Schools of economic thought:\n- Classical Economics (Classical Political Economy)\n- Keynesian Economics\n- Supply side Economics\n- Monetarism\n**There are the only ones in the test.**\n```ad-info\nThey relate to the economic **thinkers**.

There was no private entity.\n- As feudal systems lose power, it seemed natural economics would be more free.\n- **The Invisible Hand:** metaphor for demand and supply, the **forces that move the free market**.\n\t- Individuals work in self interest, and are selfish. However, as everyone works to improve themselves, everyone becomes richer and thus society becomes richer.\n- The constant change of pressures on supply and demand create natural movement of prices and the flow of trade.\n- **Laissez-faire**, meaning let it go, in an approach to the market.\n- It believes the **market will find equilibrium**, however, this is untrue, as market always moves towards equilibrium due to there always being a present force for change.\n\t- Equilibrium can be high or low, \nMain Classical Economists:\n- Adam Smith - wealth of nations\n- David Ricardo - free trade, **comparative advantage**\n- Karl Marx - Worried about the worker being abused by the capitalists, is at the end of the classical economist, because he was in the period. However, he perceived a weakness of the classical economics school.\n### Keynesian Economics\n- A school of economic thought founded by john Maynard Keynes and developed by his followers.\n- Believed consumers should spend money.\n- He placed emphasis from the study of the economic behaviour of individuals and companies to the study of the behaviour of the economy as a whole - i.e. self interest on individual not important.\n- The main idea is that **aggregate demand (total)** is created by household, business, *and government*.\n- *Dynamics* of **free market** is NOT the main force of an economy.\n\t- The nazi's created infrastructure, and helped Germany come out of the great depression early.\n\t- This is an example of government interference.\n- Said that **free markets have no self balancing mechanism**, and **government must interfere**.\n- **Government interference should be through public policies to achieve full employment and price stability**.\n- During recession, more spending, during boom less spending.\n- *Employment stimulates aggregate demand*\n- Keynesian explores when the **macroeconomy** is in recession, or  **disequilibrium**. \n\n\"He advocates interference in the market, more or less government spending depending on circumstances\"\n\n### Supply side Economics\n- Theory that income taxes reduce incentives for *work, savings, and investment,* and that accelerated **economic growth** without **inflation** can be achieved by increasing the supply of goods and services\n\t- If taxes are cut, individuals will be incentivised to work hard, earn more money, and invest\n\t- Cut business taxes will lead to employment, investment, etc.\n\t- There will be no inflation due to investment\n- Supply side economics advocates large scale **tax cuts**, for individuals and corporation, and *deregulation of business (they can do anything they want, as it will benefit economy)* and **strong incentives for investment**.\n- This doesn't usually works, as 75% of tax cuts received by corps were not invested (donald trump tax cuts). The following happened:\n\t- Gave bonuses\n\t- Share buy schemes? They buy shares, so owners get profits\n- On individual level, tax cuts had no real impact, as they weren't paying any tax anyways.\n\t- Their spending didn't change, and their savings didn't improve\n- **Theory that says increased production drives economic growth**.\n- **Factors of production:** Capital, labour, entrepreneurship and land.\n- Focuses on businesses and firms. Create jobs, people will go and spend, people will help economic growth, and more jobs will be created. \n- Examples:\n\t- Reaganomics\n\t- Bush Tax Cuts\n\t- Trump Tax Cuts\n- Economist associated with supply side:\n\t- Robert Mundell\n\t- Arthur Laffer\n\t- Herbert Stein\n\n**Keynesian vs Supply side**\n- Keynesian is driven by **aggregate demand**. When demand increases, factories will produce stuff for demand\n- Supply side says producing things first will lead to people buying it.\n\n### Monetarism\n- Monetarism is an economic theory that regards the **money supply** as the most important **driver of economic growth**. - supply of money is the most important driver of growth???\n\t- For Classical, its about market, for Keynes, its about aggregate demand, for supply, its about aggregate supply, for monetarism, its about how much **money is in circulation**. People with more money will spend it, and create **high economic growth**.\n- If you increase the money supply abut x% per year, you will get x% economic growth.\n- As money supply grows, people demand more goods,  and factories will produce more, creating new jobs and furthering economic growth. \n- Increase money supply at *exact percentage* to prevent inflationary pressures.\n- **Central banks** play a role in monetary pressures as they *control the money supply*. \n- When the money supply increases, the cost of money increases. This leads to more borrowing, lower interest rates, they will spend, and this *increases economic growth*.\n- Interest rates are the **cost of money**.\n- More money out there, cost goes down. \nEconomists:\n- Milton Friedman\n- Alan Greenspan\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.543775327Z","tags":null},"/Econ-Class-8-R":{"title":"","content":"\n# Econ Class 8 - Revision\n\n- [ ] What is economics and why you should study it\n- [ ] Importance of economics in understanding everyday activity, personally and for society\n- [ ] Explain basic economic problem\n- [ ] Explain the concept of Scarcity / choice / opportunity cost\n- [ ] Construct and use PPF to explain the basic economic problem\n- [ ] Purpose of the 4 economic questions\n\t-   What to produce\n\t-   How to produce\n\t-   How much to produce\n\t-   For whom to produce\n- [ ] Define each Factors of production with examples\n\t-   Land\n\t-   Labour\n\t-   Capital\n\t-   Enterprise\n- [ ] Explain purpose of economic systems\n- [ ] Differentiate between different economic systems\n- [ ] Compare the strengths and weaknesses of each economic system\n\t-   Market\n\t-   Mixed\n\t-   Planned\n\t-   Socialism\n\t-   Communism\n\t-    Capitalism\n- [ ] Define and describe each of the economic theories/ideas\n\t-   Classical (Adam Smith)\n\t-   Keynesian\n\t-   Supply Side\n\t-   Monetarism\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.543775327Z","tags":null},"/Econ-Class-9":{"title":"","content":"\n# Econ Class 9\n## BTC (Business Trade Cycle):\n- Fluctuations in the **rate of growth**(*growth rate*) of real output.\n- Sometimes it expands, and sometimes it contrasts, the rate at which it expands or contracts is changing.\n- A contraction could be just slowing down.\n- 2 Quarters of **negative** growth rate:\n\t- This is called a *technical recession*.\n\t- Negative growth means you produced less than what you did last time.\n- An expansion occurs when there is positive growth in real GDP, shown by those parts of the curve that slope upwards.\n- During periods of real GDP growth, employment of resources increases, and the general price level of the economy usually beings to rise more rapidly (known as inflation)\n- Peak is the highest rate of economic growth! Real GDP always grows unless its a retraction. (wtf)\n- Expansion is when the rate of economic growth is increasing.\n\n**Capacity: how much an economy can handle.**\n- How many factors of production an economy has.\n\nEconomies don't always use their full capacity. When you come out of a trough, you have **spare capacity**. Coming out a trough and beginning expansion, there will **not be any inflationary pressures**. There is *space* for expansion.\n\nAt the start, you are able to *increase output without inflation!!*\n\nWhen you get to the top of your expansion, you are starting to maximise your factors of production. The ability to produce more to meet demand becomes more difficult, this causes inflation.\n\nIn Australia, we are seeing that we are reaching the end of expansion in our business trade cycle.\n\nBecause we have low unemployment, we have a high demand for goods to be produced, however there is a labour shortage due to low employment. Therefore, there is less supply to meet demand, and we get inflationary pressures\n\n**Peak:** the maximum point of real GDP growth, marks the end of an expansion.\n- You cannot maintain a peak very long, due to capacity constraints.\n- At some point, people will be *unable to afford* an increase in prices, *reducing demand*. This leads to a **contractionary period**.\n\n**Contraction:**\n- Following the peak, the economy experiences falling real GDP (**slowing down** or negative growth).\n- If **negative growth** lasts 2 Economic Quarters, it is a recession, and caused by **falling real GDP** and **growing unemployment**.\n- **Increases in the price levels may slow down a lot**, and prices may even fall.\n- Inflationary pressures will start to *ease*.\n\n**Trough:**\n- The bottom of the business cycle, e.g. when there is a decreased economic growth (*not necessarily negative!*)\n- There may now be **widespread unemployment**.\n- A trough is followed by a new period of expansion (also known as a recovery), marking the beginning of a new cycle.\n\nIn economies there is always **a certain level of investment, and economic activity**.\n- Thus, troughs will always be temporary.\n\nThe business cycle is usually irregular, as they do not occur at regular time intervals, and are unpredictable\n\n**Good government policy** aims to *smoothen* the business cycle, and make them less volatile.\n\n- You want a **long term** of economic growth.\n\n- Upwards and downward phases of the business trade cycle are both bad in their own ways.\n- Smoothening the growth is best for the economy! \n- Flat line over a curvy line! :)\n\nImmigration gives economic growth. It leads to move people, and thus increases labour, and creates demand for more goods alongside more jobs.\n\n**Indicators Activity:**\n*Factors of Production and Labour Market*:\nFrom 2015 to 2020, there is an evident decrease in unemployment rate, while the underemployment rate remained rather stable. From 2015 to 2020, the unemployment rate went from roughly 6.1% to 5%, while the underemployment rate was almost unchanged, dropping partially from 8.8% to 8.7%. This indicates that the economy was in an expansionary phase, as labour is being sought after to fulfil capacity in the economy.\nFrom 2020 to 2022, the underemployment and unemployment rate spiked drastically as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. However, the rates have recovered and dropped significantly. The unemployment rate went from 7% at the peak of the covid-19 pandemic to 3.3%. This indicates that the economy has recovered from the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, and the economy is seeing a strong expansionary phase. In recent years it appears that the decrease in unemployment rate is decreasing, indicating that this expansionary phase may be coming to a close.\n\nIn terms of job vacancies and advertisements, from 2015 to 2020, vacancies were steadily increasing while advertisements remained relatively constant. Vacancies increased from 1.2% to 1.7%, while advertisements maintained a rate of 1.2%. This indicates an expansionary phase, as greater vacancies indicates a higher capacity of the market, and thus leading to higher economic growth. From 2020 to 2022, we see both job vacancies and advertisements fall as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, while as the economy recovered, vacancies and advertisements shot up drastically. Vacancies went from  an all-time low of 1%, not seen before in recent decades, to an all-time high of 3.4%. Advertisements went from 0.5% to roughly 2%. This indicates that despite the pandemic, the economy still has unutilized capacity for economic growth, which is now being used. This indicates an expansionary phase. Furthermore, this links to the lower unemployment rates, as high vacancies and advertisements generally indicates a low unemployment. However, this may indicate further inflationary pressures in the future if the demand for labour is not met.\n\nIn terms of participation rates, from 2015 to 2020, participation rates were increasing, going from 64.8% to 65.3%. This indicates that labour was being utilized more efficiently in the economy, indicating strong economic growth. This is characteristic of an expansionary phase. Furthermore, high participation rates coupled with low unemployment indicates that labour is in high demand, and that there is greater pressure on businesses for labour, potentially indicating a future increase in wage and inflationary pressures for the overall economy.\n\n*Household Sector*:\nFrom 2015 to 2020, disposable income appeared to be slowly growing from 0% to 2%, while consumption fell slightly from 2% to 1%. From 2020 to 2022, consumption dropped significantly initially to almost -12%, spiking drastically as the peak of the pandemic came to an end at 15% and finally ending at 4%, while disposable income spiked to about 8%, and then dropping to 1.5%. \n\nFor the saving ratio, between the years 2015 to 2020, the saving ratio initially decreased from 6% to 5% in 2018, however started to increase towards the end of 2020, to 7.8%. At the start of the 2020 pandemic, the saving ratio spiked drastically to 24%, however it has fallen to 12% in 2022, randomly spiking to 20% in the middle of 2021. \n\nIn terms of the total housing loan commitments, between the years 2015 and 2020, the rate was turbulent. From the years 2020 to 2022, the rate spiked at the peak of the covid-19 pandemic, and remaining at about $32 billion, an all-time high.\n\n*Australian Inflation*:\nFrom the years 2015 to 2020, inflation rose at an unstable rate, rising from 1.2% to just above 2%. However, inflation dropped to below 0%, due to the covid-19 pandemic. However, it has risen drastically between the years 2020 to 2022, going from below 0% to more than 6%.\n\n*Interest Rates*:\nFrom the years 2015 to 2020,  the cash rate remained constant at a stable 1.5%. It started to fall in near the end of 2019, and then dropped drastically to almost 0.1%, presumably due to the covid-19 pandemic. However, in the middle of 2021 it has recovered to about 1.3%.\n\n[saving rate?]\n\nIn terms of the total housing loan commitments, between the years 2015 and 2020, the rate was turbulent. From the years 2020 to 2022, the rate spiked at the peak of the covid-19 pandemic, and remaining at about $32 billion, an all-time high.\n\n*Business Sector*:\nIn the years 2015 to 2020, the GDP growth was steady, staying roughly around 3%. However, due to the pandemic, GDP growth dropped to -6%. In the years recovering from the pandemic, it rose to 9%, and has now dropped back down to 4%. \n\nThe indicators in the NAB business survey all display moderate growth before the pandemic, a steep decline, and a quick recovery.\n\n*Level of firm investment*:\nBusiness investment has only been declining. It appears unaffected by the pandemic, bar a slight increase. It dropped from 13% in 2015 to 11% in 2022.\n\nWage price index growth stayed quite consistent throughout 2015 to 2020, however it was turbulent with highs and lows.\n\nIn terms of business investment components, machinery has remained constant, however, it has been declining in recent years, dropping from 4.2% in 2015 to 4% in 2022. Engineering was coming down from a large spike in 2015, and has since been declining, dropping from 3.4% in 2015 to 2.8% in 2022. For buildings, it has remained stable but is in decline, going from 2.5% to 2.3%.\n\n*Economic Growth*:\nWay before the global pandemic, GDP growth was rather low. It stayed close to 3%, bar some small peaks. During the pandemic, GDP growth dropped to about -6%, but has since recovered to almost 45.\n\nThe indicators for capacity utilisation all display moderate growth before the pandemic, a steep decline, and a quick recovery. Company profits and levels of investment show similar trends\n\n*Government*:\nThe government budget balance has been in deficit for many years. Briefly before 2008, the government saw major surplus, however since then the government has been in deficit, however, this deficit appears to be improving towards a surplus. The size of these deficits have been decreasing in the last 5 years. This indicates that economic activity is growing.\n\n*Commodities*:\nLNG prices have spiked in recent years, going to almost 200 USD per barrel. This appears to be stabilising, and is now currently 150 USD per barrel.\nBrent oil has only been increasing however, going from 25 USD per barrel during the covid pandemic to 23 USD per barrel.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.543775327Z","tags":null},"/Econ-Class-Notes":{"title":"","content":"\n# Econ Class Notes\n\n- [[Econ Class 1]]\n- [[Econ Class 2]]\n- [[Econ Class 3]]\n- [[Econ Class 4]]\n- [[Econ Class 5]]\n- [[Econ Class 6]]\n- [[Econ Class 7]]\n- [[Econ Class 8 - R]]\n- [[Econ Class 9]]\n- [[Econ Class 10]]\n- [[Econ Class 11]]\n- [[Econ Class 12]]\n- [[Econ Class 13]]\n- [[Econ Class 14]]\n- [[Econ Class 15]]\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.543775327Z","tags":null},"/Electron-Configuration":{"title":"","content":"# Electron Configuration:\n\n\n**Generic Electron Configuration**:\n* This is the basic electron configuration that you are taught in Yr 8\n* Essentially, the first shell of an atom can hold 2 electrons.\n* The second shell can hold 8 electrons.\n* The third shell **usually** holds 8 electrons, however it has space for 10 more.\n* The formula $2n^2$ describes the **total possible electrons in an electron shell**.\n\t* Here, n represents the **principal quantum number**, or the **energy level notation**.\n\n**Subshells - Electronic Configuration:**\n* Electrons are arranged in energy levels or shells\n* Energy of shells increases as distance from nucleus increases.\n* n is the principle quantum number which shows energy\n* The maximum number of each shell is $2n^2$\n\n* Shells are divided into **sub-shells**.\n* n = 1 has a single s subshell\n* n = 2 has s **and** p subshells\n* n = 3 has s, p and d subshells\n* The subshells are:\n\t* **s, p, d, f**\n\n\n* The 's' subshells holds a maximum of 2 electrons.\n* The 'p' subshells holds a maximum of 6 electrons.\n* The 'd' subshells holds a maximum of 10 electrons.\n* The 'f' subshells holds a maximum of 14 electrons\n\n**Valency:**\n* The **combining power** of an atom, is equal to **the number of hydrogen atoms** it could combine/displace.\n* **Valency vs Valence electrons**\n\t* Valence def stated above, whereas Valence electrons refer to the **number of electrons** in an atom's Valence (outer) shell.\n\t* e.g. Nitrogen: Valency of 3(-), but has a number of Valence electrons of 5.\n* **Principal quantum shells** – the shells of an atom. \n\t* e.g. Sodium's principal quantum shells are 2, 8, 1.\n* **Nuclear attraction:** Effective nuclear attraction is derived by substracting the number of inner (core) electrons (which 'shield' the valence electrons) from the nuclear charge of an atom (how many protons in an atoms nucleus)\n\n**Electronegativity:** a higher density of atoms? ==research this==\n\n\n**'-'block elements:**\n* To be an 'x'-block element, the **outer subshell** must be an 'x' shell (x being s, p, d or f)\n* E.g.

Two distinctively radical schools of thought had entrenched themselves deep within the community, creating a sharp division between the beliefs of the townsfolk. On one hand, a devoutly religious congregation, and on the other, a purely scientific, technologically driven perspective. An unquestionably prominent tension had risen, with both sides prepared to set the town ablaze in a firestorm of fury.\n\nLeaning on a pole opposite a dimly lit door, Reverend Lorenzo spotted the slender man slowly approaching under the veil of the night sky. The pitch black surrounding the man quickly parted ways, revealing a plain white coat and an eccentric, recalcitrant hairstyle.\n\n“Ah, Reverend. What a beautifully clear night sky! How fascinating that the clouds have cleared.\"\n\n“Indeed, perhaps we have God to thank for such calming, tranquil weather”\"\n\n\"Perhaps you should put your faith in something more realistic, more grounded, and more logical”\n\n\"Now, save your argument for another time. Past this door is a wine bottle with your name on it.\"\n\nThe two entered through the door, revealing an isolated pub. Pushing past the door, a bell rang. Sitting down near the front of the bar, the scientist pulled out of his coat an artificial hand made of pig fat and straw, out of place among the earthy wood flooring and crimson flames of candles. He signalled the bartender, carefully projecting his voice to order two glasses of the tavern’s finest wine.\n\n\"What do you think of this place?\" The Reverend inquired.\n\n“I’ve only heard good things about the wine here. I suspect they use a more refined methodology of wine extraction, alongside fresher grapes.”\n\n\"My my, no need to overthink such things. I’m confident it's due to the expertise of the vintner.\"\n\nThe inventor’s eye twitched. With a strained voice, the inventor asked, \"Well then, to what do I owe the pleasure of meeting you today?\"\n\n\"I feel the church is getting rather archaic in the coming years. Just last week, a tile came down and nearly sent me on an early trip to Heaven.\"\n\nThe inventor twitched again. He started tapping erratically on the table.\n\n\"Interesting. Any ideas for what I could do to assist you, Reverend?\"\n\n“Well, I was thinking you could provide some insights. As a man of God, I feel woefully unspecialised in terms of creativity. I am a preacher, not a thinker.\"\n\nThe tapping stopped. \"Oh,\" The inventor inquired in a surprised, partially elated voice, “in that case, I have many suggestions on how to improve the quality and prestige of your church. Have you considered a religious newspaper? All you would need to do is write your sermons, and they could be delivered without a word said.\"\n\nThe Reverend took a large sip from his glass. \"Preaches are not simply words strung together. There is a wholly human feeling conveyed when I preach in front of an audience. I assure you, it will take technology a thousand years before they can replace the sense of connection you feel when you go to mass.\"\n\nThe inventor frowned. \"There is no such thing as this ‘human connection’ you’re talking about, Reverend. A printing press could easily do your job in a fraction of the time and effort.\"\n\nA sharp red flame smouldered in the Reverend’s eyes, only to be extinguished abruptly.\n\n\"Now now, we’re going off-topic, my friend. In the meantime, we can ponder over your religious paper another day.”\n\n“Perhaps I could set up a clinic and cure the ailments of your patrons.”\n\nWhat is there to cure? God’s work done in God’s way will never lack God’s supplies. The Lord has a plan for all of his children. To artificially cure one of their diseases is to go against the will of God. \"\n\n\"Well, does God have no heart?\" The inventor violently snapped. Does he have no empathy, no compassion, no soul? How could he condemn children to death? \"\n\n\"I’ve had enough of your bickering!\" The Reverend snapped back. He had risen from his seat, a rare instance of anger resonating from the benign Reverend.\n\n“You need this job as much as I do,” The Reverend softly spoke. “Let’s calm down. Surely you have other ideas. \"\n\nAn atmosphere of outrage emanated from the inventor. All of his body was tense, as if he was preparing for a fight.\n\nGradually, the rage subsided into disappointment. A sense of defeat rushed over the inventor. He was one of the greatest minds of San Latzio, yet he was burdened with serving another as a consequence of his lack of fame and funding.\n\nYou’re right, Reverend. It was very illogical of me to speak in such an uncontrolled manner. Truth be told, my late father was a Christian, and the thing he wanted most out of a church, as a rather educated worshipper, was his own copy of the Bible. Perhaps, if you’d so graciously let me, I could distribute paper versions of the Bible, so followers could read along with you. \"\n\nThe Reverend pondered for a bit. \"Interesting,\" he responded, \"It's brilliant! Giving everyone a bible will bring them close to God. I’ll fund your printing press as soon as you can start working on it. \"\n\n\"Great! \"I'll start working on it tomorrow, and I'll keep you updated as I go,\" the inventor said excitedly, \"It's been a pleasure working with you, Reverend.\"\n\nLikewise, my friend, I hope we meet again.\n\nThe Reverend’s use of a printing press was a resounding success for San Latzio’s small community church, bringing international recognition and making the Reverend an icon of Christianity. His following would grow tenfold, allowing him to fulfil his dream of preaching to the largest possible audience.\n\nThe inventor’s brilliant invention of the printing press brought him renown among his fellow inventors, securing him an invitation to the finest, intellectual parts of society. Forever named in the history books, he would go on to revolutionise society with his many inventions.\n\n#10ENG ","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.543775327Z","tags":null},"/English-Creative-Assessment-2nd-Draft":{"title":"","content":"An ocean of hatred had washed over the once quiet town of San Latzio.

An unquestionably prominent tension had risen, with both sides prepared to set the town ablaze in a firestorm of fury.\n\nThe Reverend sat at the front table of a local pub. It was well known for its exquisite vintage wine as San Latzio's gold standard, alongside being notoriously hard to find. \n\nPerhaps his acquaintance had lost themselves while looking for the dimly lit alleyway the bar discretely resided in. \n\nJust as the Reverend prepared to leave, a figure emerged from the pub's door. The candle-lit flames of the bar illuminated a plain white coat, and an eccentric, recalcitrant hairstyle. He was an amateur inventor, seeking fame in a world overcome by greed. \n\n\"Ah, Reverend! Forgive me for my lack of punctuality, I managed to enter the wrong pub!\"\n\n\"Not to worry, my friend. Please, have a seat.\" The Reverend gestured to the empty seat opposite to his.\n\nAs the Inventor took a seat, the Reverend signalled the bartender. \"Two glasses of your finest wine, please.\" \n\nThe Inventor looked in shock. \"Reverend, you overestimate my financial status. I simply cannot afford such quality wine.\" \n\"Luckily for you, my friend, I'll be paying for your drinks tonight. It's the least I can do to return your gratitude. I'm sure you could've spent this time on much more pressing matters.\"\n\nThe Inventor smiled. He wasn't expecting such a kind, generous demeanour from a devout Christian. \n\nGrowing up in a heavily conservative family meant dealing with religion was difficult. His father's numerous lectures on a youthful Inventor's lack of piety pushed him into the sciences, and away from the embrace of God.\n\n\"Well then, Reverend. To what do I owe the pleasure of discussing with you today?\"\n\n\"The church is getting very rundown as of recent years. Just last week, a loose ceiling tile nearly sent me to God!\" The Reverend joked.\n\nThe Inventor let out a heavy sigh. This was the religious zealot he had come accustomed to as a citizen of San Latzio. One that could not go more than two sentences without mentioning God.\n\n\"Interesting. Any ideas for what I could do to assist you, Reverend?\"\n\n\"Sadly, as a man of God, I lack the creativity to produce ideas.

Have you considered a medicinal clinic? Evidence shows an increase in ailments uncured due to religion.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" The Reverend exclaimed in a burst of impulse. \"The Lord has a plan for all of his children. To artificially cure is to go against the will of God.\"\n\n\"Well then, does God have no heart?\" The Inventor violently snapped. \"How could he condemn children to death?\"\n\nA deathly silence engulfed the table. Both men were standing up from their chair, anger consuming their rationality. \n\nA sharp red flame smouldered in the Reverend's eyes, only to be extinguished by the sight of a familiar face. \n\nA middle-aged man walked through the pub's door. A dirty white smock spreading dirt and vegetation on the bar's floor, it was as if he had just arrived from a farm. \n\n\"Reverend! Fancy seeing you here!\" The man spoke as his lifted his brown hat from his head. \n\n\"Ah, James. I have the honour to meet you once again.\"\n\nThe Reverend paused. He did not know how to introduce the Inventor, he knew all too well James' opinion on science.\n\n\"You look familiar. Where have I seen your face before?\" James inquired.\n\n\"He's a deacon at a neighbouring church. We've been discussing his duties.\" The Reverend responded.\n\n\"Hold on. Aren't you that sacrilegious heretic that goes against the will of God? What do you call yourself, an 'inventor'?\"\n\n\"How dare you!\" The Inventor exclaimed. \"Just because I don't buy all this illogical, made-up nonsense about religious, does not mean you can insult my title.\"\n\n\"Some title. You take pride in being an arrogant fool, grasping at wheat straws when God has the answer.\"\n\n\"Who is the true fool, someone who investigates and analyses for their truth or one who takes 'truth' from the mouths of liars?\"\n\n\"My God! How dare you insult the Lord!\" James shouted, as he grabbed the Inventor's glass of wine and held it up towards the Inventor's head.\n\n\"That's enough!\" The Reverend shouted. Both men recoiled in shock, as they had never seen such a pious man release so much anger. James dropped the glass, causing it to shatter into a thousand fragments.\n\nA subtle peace filled the almost desolate pub. \n\n\"My friend,\" the Reverend spoke, breaking the silence, \"would God appreciate you harassing another one of God's children?\"\n\n\"And you,\" the Reverend turned to the Inventor, \"is it rational and logical to argue over topics such as religion?\"\n\n\"Now, James, please pay the bartender for their troubles in replacing the glass.\"\n\nWithout word, James drifted towards the bartender, softly apologising. \n\n\"Thank you, Reverend.\" The Inventor finally spoke. He had never felt such respect for a man of religion before. \n\n\"I have an idea, for your church.\"\n\n\"Brilliant, I'll get your funding to you as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe two would meet frequently after their first encounter. Working together, they would improve the Reverend's church while earning the Inventor the fame he desired.\n\nThe idea of science working alongside religion spread, bringing peace and prosperity at last to San Latzio.\n\n\n\n#10ENG ","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/English-Creative-Practice":{"title":"","content":"*Date: 2022 06 23 Time: 13:26*\n\nStatus: #10LIT\n\nthis was a 10 minute practice writing for english, where i had to use specific words.\n\n# English Creative Practice\n\nClaudia got off her bicycle as she arrived at the café.

This is most prominent in the literature and artistic works of turbulent time-periods. The short story 'Immersion' (2012) by Aliette de Bodard is set in a space dystopia where the Galactic and Rong cultures mimic contemporary issues of racism through the use of Immersers which manipulate appearance to appear ethnically Galactic. Similarly, 'The Pedestrian' (1951) by Ray Bradbury in set in a defunct future of the United States where entire cities spend their nights watching television, and the only citizen who experiences individuality, Leonard Mead, is persecuted. Although both texts were written in different time periods, the 21st and 20th century respectively, both convey a sceptical attitude towards technology. Both texts promote an intrinsic value of family, culture and human connection, alongside a critical, sceptical attitude towards technology and challenge the progressive attitudes of readers that are passionate about technology.\n\nBy presenting an expressive dialogue context of a silent community, both 'Immersion' and 'The Pedestrian' promote a strong value of human connection in society and challenge their audience’s pessimism towards in-person communication. In 'Immersion', de Bodard presents to readers a conversation between Rong girl Quy's second uncle and the Galactic man Galen Santos where both speech and appearance has been modified by the use of immersers, when Second Uncle \"rubbed his hands, … a Galactic expression of satisfaction.\" This characterisation of Second Uncle as a financially driven person who uses technology at a cost of his connection to his Rong culture alienates minor ethnic groups within society, such as the Rong. In doing so, de Bodard challenges the audience’s inspired attitude towards technology, by presenting a technological society where humanity is marginalised. Furthermore, in 'The Pedestrian', Leonard Mead walks down a quiet street, asking the dimly lit houses \"What is it now? Eight-thirty P.M.? Time for a dozen assorted murders? A quiz? A revue? A comedian falling off the stage?\" Leonard Mead's one-sided dialogue and repetition highlights his isolation in the largely populated city he lives in. This depressing atmosphere further promotes the importance of human connection in contemporary society, as it forces readers to register how bleak and mundane a world without interaction is. In contrast, the audience’s value of technology as an indicator of scientific development and their disregard towards traditional values of human connection is challenged, as both texts articulate the dehumanising impacts of technology. Thus, using a subtle dialogue and imagery enhanced by the lack of a response, both texts further promote the significance of human connection to the reader, challenging the audience's more progressive views on family values.\n\nBoth 'Immersion' and 'The Pedestrian' promote a concerned attitude towards society's disregard for individuality. In 'The Pedestrian', Leonard Mead is highlighted as the only person \"in a city of three million\" who regularly walks down the silent streets of the city, rather than conform to society's expectations of him to spend his nights watching television. Bradbury describes how Leonard Mead was \"alone in this world\", and how walking through the streets \"was not unequal to walking through a graveyard\". Bradbury's emphasis of the streets completely devoid of life enhances the unnatural aesthetic of the empty city. Furthermore, de Bodard's 'Immersion' critiques the need for disenfranchised members of society to fit in, and how such changes strip individuals of their individuality. In 'Immersion', Agnes, a native Rong who chose to constantly wear an immerser to become more Galactic, describes how \"It's people like you who have to work the hardest to adjust, because so much of you draws attention to itself—the stretched eyes that crinkle in the shapes of moths, the darker skin...\". Through the use of this representation of a marginalised population changing to appear like a more prominent race, de Bodard condemns contemporary society's ostracism of unique cultures and individuals. Thus, by utilising characterisation via internal monologues, both texts emphasise the necessity for concern regarding society's cynical attitudes towards individuality.\n\nFurthermore, both texts promote a critical attitude towards technology and its effect on individuality, challenging the expected values of their science-fiction audience. In 'Immersion', Agnes explains how immersers are \"a Galactic toy\", and \"it takes a Galactic to believe that you can take a whole culture and reduce it to algorithms\". This use of an internal dialogue further promotes a sceptical attitude towards technology. de Bodard emphasises how technology can be used to control culture and homogenise society. Similarly, Bradbury's 'The Pedestrian' further describes the uncanny ability for technology to mimic humanity, and its effect as an eradicator of individuality. When describing the \"one lone car wandering and wandering the empty streets\", Bradbury emphasises how the car would speak \"in a metallic whisper\", how \"there was no one in the front seat\", and how the car \"hesitated, or rather gave a faint whirring click\". This personification of the automatic police car seeks to confuse the audience, who respond with unease as the separation between humankind and technology is blurred. This works to promote a fearful attitude towards technology's ability to imitate humans, challenging the audience's endearing and hopeful attitude towards technology. Thus, by utilising personification and dialogue, both texts promote to their audiences a doubtful attitude towards technology, further challenging their audiences' own positive attitudes towards technology.\n\nThus, by utilising dialogue, imagery and personification, both texts successfully promote a value of human connection, and promote an antagonising attitude towards technology's effects on individuality. Furthermore, the texts critiques contemporary society's degrading attitudes towards individuality. This works to challenge the more technologically-inclined audience, opposing their progressive and endearing attitude towards technology, and a sense of disregard for technology's effect on individuality. Both text's expression of concern regarding technology's threat to individuality seeks to resonate with their audience. Both authors utilise their texts to promote their personal uneasiness over the looming threats to modern society.\n\n# Quotes\n\n**The Pedestrian**\n\n1. **Human connection/family/cultural values**\n\t1. \"he was alone in this world of A.D. 2053, or as good as alone,\"\n\t2. \"it was not unequal to walking through a graveyard\"\n\t3. \"Sudden gray phantoms seemed to manifest upon inner room walls... there were whisperings and murmurs where a window in a tomb-like building was still open.\"\n\t4. \"an entire street [would] be startled by the passing of a lone figure,\"\n\t5. \"The street was silent and long and empty,\"\n\t6. \"In ten years of walking... he had never met another person walking,\"\n\t7. \n2. **Society's attitudes towards individuality**\n\t1. \"he was alone in this world of A.D. 2053, or as good as alone,\"\n3. **Critical attitude towards technology and its effects on individuality.**\n\t1. \"this one lone car wandering and wandering the empty streets.\"\n\n**Immersion**\n\n1. **Human connection/family/cultural values**\n\t1. \n2. **Society's attitudes towards individuality**\n\t1. \n3. **Critical attitude towards technology and its effects on individuality.**\n\t1. \n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/English-Essay-Draft-2":{"title":"","content":"*Date: 20220510 Time: 0918*\n\nStatus: #10ENG \n\n# English Essay Draft\n\nQuestion (4): Discuss how particular values and attitudes are **promoted** within at least one studied text to **challenge** an audience.\n\nIndividuals in society reflect their own concerns over the direction their community takes.

In 'Immersion', de Bodard presents to readers a conversation between Second Uncle and Galactic Galen Santos, when Second Uncle \"rubbed his hands, … a Galactic expression of satisfaction.\" This characterisation of Second Uncle as a financially driven person who sacrifices his connection to his Rong culture for smoother interactions with his Galactic customers portrays him as immoral in his willingness to discard his cultural norms and values. This further conveys how authentic human connection is lost when Second Uncle actively suppresses his speaking habits. In doing so, de Bodard challenges the audience’s indifference towards the necessity for human connection within society. Furthermore, in 'The Pedestrian', Leonard Mead walks down a silent street, asking the houses \"What is it now? Eight-thirty P.M.? Time for a dozen assorted murders? A quiz? A revue?\" Through his repetition of rhetorical questions and flamboyant actions, Leonard Mead's characterisation as embracing his freedom while being isolated from society promotes the importance of human connection in contemporary society, as it forces readers to register how bleak and mundane a world without interaction is. In contrast, the audience’s value of technology as an indicator of scientific development and their disregard towards traditional values of human connection is challenged, as both texts articulate the dehumanising impacts of technology. Thus, using a subtle dialogue and imagery enhanced by the lack of a response, both texts further promote the significance of human connection to the reader, challenging the audience's more apathetic views on family values.\n\n'Immersion' and 'The Pedestrian' both promote a worried attitude regarding society's disdain for distinctiveness, while challenging their audiences' own beliefs on individuality. In 'The Pedestrian', Leonard Mead is portrayed as the only person \"in a city of three million\" who regularly walks down the empty streets of the city, rather than conform to society's expectations of him to spend his nights watching television. Bradbury describes how Leonard Mead was \"alone in this world\", and how walking through the streets \"was not unequal to walking through a graveyard\". Bradbury's use of a simile to present the streets as completely devoid of life enhances the unnatural aesthetic of the empty city. In doing so, Bradbury details a society of conformity, demonstrating to audiences a society opposed to individuality. This challenges Bradbury's audience's apathy towards society's ignorance of individuality, describing their focus on technological progress as detrimental to societal well-being. Furthermore, de Bodard's 'Immersion' critiques the need for disenfranchised members of society to fit in, and how such changes harms individuality. In 'Immersion', Agnes, a native Rong who chose to constantly wear an immerser to become more Galactic, describes how ==\"It's people like you who have to work the hardest to adjust... the stretched eyes that crinkle in the shapes of moths, the darker skin...\". (shorten this)== Through the use of imagery, de Bodard presents ethnic Rong people as inhuman and outcasted from the text's society. In doing so, de Bodard condemns contemporary society's ostracism of unique cultures and individuals. Thus, by utilising characterisation via internal monologues, both texts emphasise the necessity for concern regarding modern society's desire for homogeneity ==(and conformity?)==.\n\nFurthermore, both texts advocate a critical approach towards technology and its impact on individuality, challenging their science-fiction audience's endearing values of technology. In 'Immersion', Agnes explains how immersers are \"a Galactic toy\", and \"it takes a Galactic to believe that you can take a whole culture and reduce it to algorithms\". This use of a nihilistic, cynical presents a sombre attitude towards technology. de Bodard emphasises how technology can be used to control culture and homogenise society. Similarly, Bradbury's 'The Pedestrian' further describes the uncanny ability for technology to mimic humanity, and its effect as an eradicator of individuality. When describing the \"one lone car wandering and wandering the empty streets\", Bradbury emphasises how the car would speak \"in a metallic whisper\", and how \"there was no one in the front seat\". This personification of the automatic police car seeks to confuse the audience, who respond with unease as the separation between humankind and technology is blurred. The artificial lack of humanity works to promote a fearful attitude towards technology's ability to imitate humans, challenging the audience's endearing and hopeful attitude towards technology. Thus, by utilising personification and dialogue, both texts promote  a doubtful attitude towards technology, further challenging their audiences' own optimistic attitudes towards technology.\n\nThus, by utilising dialogue, imagery and personification, both texts successfully promote the value of human connection, and antagonising attitudes towards technology's effects on individuality. Furthermore, the texts critiques contemporary society's apathetic attitudes towards individuality, to challenge the more technologically-inclined audience, opposing their optimistic, endearing attitude towards technology, and sense of disregard for technology's effect on individuality. Both text's expression of concern regarding technology's threat to individuality seeks to resonate with their audience and promote their personal uneasiness over the looming threats to modern society. In this way, texts are able to confront their audiences and critique relevant issues with societal progress.\n\n**Biblography(Harvard Referencing System):**\n- Bradbury, R., 1951. _The Pedestrian_.

This can be seen in 'Immersion' (2012) by Aliette de Bodard and 'The Pedestrian' (1951) by Ray Bradbury, two science fiction short stories that challenge the ways their technologically inclined audiences view their interaction with technology. 'Immersion' is set in a space dystopia where the Galactic and Rong cultures mimic contemporary issues of racism through the use of Immersers which manipulate appearance to appear ethnically Galactic. On the other hand, 'The Pedestrian' is set in a defunct future of the United States where entire cities spend their nights watching television, and the only citizen who experiences individuality, Leonard Mead, is persecuted. Although both texts were written in different time periods, audiences from both time periods hold a strong interest in technology. Both texts promote an intrinsic value of culture and human connection, alongside a critical attitude towards dominant groups' imposition of conformity in their society. A sceptical attitude towards technology is also advocated, with both texts challenging the progressive and often optimistic attitudes of Western science fiction readers.\n\nBy presenting unique characterisations that contrast their dull environment, both 'Immersion' and 'The Pedestrian' promote the importance of human connection in society and confront their audience's aversion to personal interaction. In 'Immersion', de Bodard presents to readers a conversation between Second Uncle and Galactic Galen Santos, when Second Uncle \"rubbed his hands, … a Galactic expression of satisfaction.\" This characterisation of Second Uncle as a financially driven person who sacrifices his connection to his Rong culture for smoother interactions with his Galactic customers portrays him as immoral in his willingness to discard his cultural norms and values. This emphasises the importance of valuing authentic human connection by presenting an artificially perfect dialogue as lacking vital human qualities such as distinct cultural communication styles. In doing so, de Bodard challenges the audience’s indifference towards the necessity for human connection within society. Furthermore, in 'The Pedestrian', Leonard Mead walks down a silent street, asking the houses \"What is it now? Eight-thirty P.M.? Time for a dozen assorted murders? A quiz? A revue?\" Through his repetition of rhetorical questions and flamboyant actions, Leonard Mead's characterisation as being isolated from society promotes the importance of personal communication in contemporary society, as it forces readers to register how bleak and mundane a world without interaction is. In contrast, the audience’s disregard towards traditional values of social connection is challenged, as both texts articulate the bleakness of societies where communication is subtly distorted beyond recognition or non-existent between citizens. Thus, by utilising characterisation, both texts further promote the significance of human connection to the reader, condemning their audience's more apathetic views on social interaction.\n\n'Immersion' and 'The Pedestrian' both promote a disapproving attitude regarding a dominant attitude towards a conformist society, while challenging their audiences' own unconcerned beliefs on individuality. In 'The Pedestrian', Leonard Mead is portrayed as the only person \"in a city of three million\" who regularly walks down the empty streets of the city, rather than conform to society's expectations of him to spend his nights watching television. Bradbury describes how Leonard Mead was \"alone in this world\", and how walking through the streets \"was not unequal to walking through a graveyard\". Bradbury's use of a simile to present the streets as completely devoid of life enhances the unnatural aesthetic of the empty city. In doing so, Bradbury details a society of conformity, constructing to audiences a censorious attitude towards society's predominantly conformist beliefs. This challenges Bradbury's audience's indifferent attitude towards society's ignorance to individuality, portraying their lack of compassion regarding conformity as damaging to societal well-being. Furthermore, de Bodard's 'Immersion' critiques the need for disenfranchised members of society to fit in, and how such changes harms individuality. In 'Immersion', Agnes, a native Rong who chose to constantly wear an immerser to become more Galactic, describes how \"It's people like you who have to work the hardest to adjust... the stretched eyes that crinkle in the shapes of moths, the darker skin...\".  Through the use of imagery, de Bodard presents ethnic Rong people as inferior and imperfect in the context of their own society. In doing so, de Bodard condemns contemporary society's favouring of specific cultures and the hypercritical effect of conformity on the psyches of minor ethnicities. Thus, by utilising characterisation via imagery, both texts emphasise the necessity for concern regarding modern society's desire for homogeneity and mindless conformity.\n\nFurthermore, both texts advocate a critical attitude towards technology's impact on individuality, challenging their science-fiction audience's endearing values of technology. In 'Immersion', Agnes explains how immersers are \"a Galactic toy\", and \"it takes a Galactic to believe that you can take a whole culture and reduce it to algorithms\". This use of a cynical tone presents a dismal attitude towards technology. de Bodard emphasises how technology can be used to control culture, challenging their Western audience's affectionate attitude towards technology by highlighting its disturbing ability to manipulate individuality. Similarly, Bradbury's 'The Pedestrian' further describes the uncanny ability for technology to mimic humanity, and its effect as an eradicator of individuality. When describing the \"one lone car wandering and wandering the empty streets\", Bradbury emphasises how the car would speak \"in a metallic whisper\", and how \"there was no one in the front seat\". This personification of the automatic police car seeks to confuse the audience, who respond with unease as the separation between humankind and technology is blurred. The artificial lack of humanity works to promote a fearful attitude towards technology's ability to deconstruct and manipulate individuality, challenging the audience's endearing and hopeful attitude towards technology. Thus, by utilising personification and dialogue, both texts promote a doubtful attitude towards technology, further challenging their audiences' own optimistic attitudes towards technology.\n\nThus, by utilising dialogue, imagery and personification, both texts successfully promote the value of human connection, and antagonising attitudes towards technology's effects on individuality. Furthermore, the texts critiques contemporary society's apathetic attitudes towards individuality, to challenge the more technologically-inclined audience, opposing their optimistic, endearing attitude towards technology, and sense of disregard for technology's effect on individuality.

Being considered a 'boat person' himself, his bestseller \"A soulless ocean\" has brought to light the struggles that countless families bravely fought for a chance at a new life in Australia. Hải Minh, what do you think about Dutton's recent zero-tolerance policy of boat refugees?\n\n**Hải Minh:** It's frankly outrageous. I find it difficult to believe that Australia, one of the strongest democracies in the free world, could implement such an unsympathetic, authoritarian border policy. I can still remember the journey I embarked on as my family left Vietnam. My family had owned a prosperous farm near Saigon, and had a comfortable life. However, when the North seized Saigon, they took everything away from us. The farm was confiscated by the state, and we had to share all of our hard-earned wealth and belongings with Northern soldiers, who treated us like slaves.\n\n**Host:** That sounds horrible. Please continue.\n\n**Hải Minh:** Well, my family saw no other option but to leave. There was no freedom for us in Vietnam, and we had a target on our back for supporting the South in the war. So we gathered as many valuables as we could find, and my father paid for our extended family to leave for Australia. I was only 10, so I can barely recall life in Vietnam, but I definitely can remember the journey. I shouldn't call it a journey, as it was more of a punishment. A punishment for leaving Vietnam, for leaving people behind. Any family I have left there are either dead or their whereabouts are unknown. The voyage was heartless, with the waves thundering like the artillery shells back at home. It was as if I had never left. I was still hurdled in a corner, desperately grabbing the floor in the hopes a big wave wouldn't send me overboard. The suffocating winds of salt was overcome by the smell of vomit. This was a struggle that everyone onboard endured, for months on end. Not everyone made it through. My grandmother would pass away a few kilometres from the shores of Australia.\n\n**Host:** I'm deeply sorry for your loss.\n\n**Hải Minh:** She was one of the lucky ones. She was buried in Australia. Those that died before here would be thrown into the sea. Their grave being the vast waterbed of the Pacific. Our family went through all this pain, suffering and torture, just to make it to Australia. To have a new life, one of personal and economic liberty. For them, the risk of dying a thousand kilometres away from home among the waves was worth it. \n\n**Host:** And now Dutton's new policy has taken away this opportunity for anyone else.\n\n**Hải Minh:** It's even worse than that. Dutton's so-called Operation Sovereign Borders completely fails to inform potential refugees that they will be denied. So all it does is send boats back. Without any sort of support, or protection. Sure, your family may have perished and you are unable to enter your home country without death looming, but the Australian government will still deny you access to the fabled land of freedom just a few meters away. There is no sense of morality in Dutton's policy. There is only arrogance, and insensitivity to the plight of refugees. \n\n**Host:** How would you say this policy affects Australia's image worldwide.\n\n**Hải Minh:** It's worrying, to be sure. When a first-world, free nation starts denying people with nowhere to go, one might question the humanitarian intent of the Australian government. Australia is a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention, so it's rather concerning when 47 member states called out the Australian Government's refugee policies, pointing out a non-robust and discriminatory approach to refugee arriving by boat. \n\n**Host:** Do you think the UN has the right to condemn or enforce a more lenient refugee policy in Australia?\n\n**Hải Minh:** Absolutely. Australia chose to ratify the Refugee Convention. They should understand and adhere to its clear, well-defined points. The lives of refugees should not be a political hammer for the ruling party to beat the opposite with.\n\n**Host:** Agreed, these are families we're talking about. Families with nothing left anymore, who have no choice but to become refugees in the hopes of a better life. Now, take a look at this picture.\n\n(Picture of refugees show)\n\n![[Pasted image 20220331135611.png]]\n\n**Host:** What do you think of this?\n\n**Hải Minh:** It's an unfortunate reality we live in. None of these people want to be refugees. They just want to survive, and have the best opportunity at life. When we send back boats, we are denying refugees their basic human rights to freedom of movement. I am fortunate to have had many great moments in my life. But none were as joyous or rewarding when I got off the boat. Having made it through the thundering hell that is the Pacific, I could really appreciate the tranquillity and silence of Australia. The calm tides washing over my feet, it was as if I was reborn. My family had nothing to their name, so we had to work hard to survive. But we did. We did so with a smile on our face, because we knew the alternative was a cold, bitter life as workers under Vietnam's tyrannical government. \n\n**Host:** So arriving at the shores of Australia liberated you from your loyalty to Vietnam.\n\n**Hải Minh:** Exactly. At that moment, I became an Australian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n# References","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/English-Podcast-Draft-2":{"title":"","content":"# English Podcast Transcript\n\n**Cast:**\n* Host \n* Guest speaker\n\n(Tradition Vietnamese music plays in the background)\n\n**Host (1):** Hey there!

Hải Minh, what do you think about Dutton's recent budget media release?\n\n(Screen shows a picture of Dutton at a press conference, which fades back into intro screen as **Hải Minh** talks.)\n\n**Hải Minh (1):** It's frankly outrageous.

What do you think about the plight of other refugees?\n\n(Picture of refugees show)\n\n**Hải Minh (6):** They just want to survive, and have the best opportunity at life. When we send back boats, we are denying refugees their basic human rights to live free from tyranny. I am fortunate to have had many great moments in my life. But none were as joyous or rewarding when I got off the boat and stepped foot onto an Australian harbour. Having made it through the treacherous journey across the Pacific, I could really appreciate the tranquillity and silence of Australia.\n\n**Host: (4)** How did you and your family adapt to this new environment?\n\n**Hải Minh: (7)** My family had nothing to their name, so we had to work hard to survive. And we did. With a smile on our face, because we knew the alternative was a cold, bitter life as workers under Vietnam's tyrannical government. \n\nFunny story, my birthday, ten days ago, isn't even my real birthday. Before we fled, the communists even took our birth certificates. My parents didn't know the birthdays of their ten children, so they just gave me one. That's how monstrous the Vietnamese government was to us.\n\n**Host (5):** Wow. I admire you for finding humour in a truly dire situation. What do you remember of your past life?\n\n(Traditional Vietnamese song returns temporarily)\n\n**Hải Minh: (8)** Ah, there are definitely some things I miss from Vietnam. If I focus really hard, I can still recall the times when my whole family would sing to me a traditional Vietnamese song, I only have my mother to sing to me now. Sometimes, when I pass by a Vietnamese restaurant, the smell reminds me of my last meal of phở in Vietnam, before all I would smell for months would be stomach fluid and mildew.\n\n(Western song returns)\n\n**Host (6):** Do you return to the harbour where you first stepped foot in Australia often?\n\n**Hải Minh: (9)** Absolutely. I regularly go back and just sit in the sand with my family. My life in Vietnam ended there, but my life as an Australian began. The restful flow of the waves remind me of my journey, and those I had left behind. Precious memories, falling from my mind and into the ocean like handfuls of sand. I will never forget the first time I grasped the cool, saline seaside, it was the day I became Australian.\n\n**Host (7):** Amazing. \n\n(End music rolls, back to intro screen)\n\nWell, thank you for joining us this evening.

Bodard","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/English-Short-Speech":{"title":"","content":"Sustainability is not simply an ideology one can take, but a necessary sacrifice we must make as a species for our own self-preservation.\n\nPerhaps you envision a climate change activist as a childish university student who shouts back the eco-friendly rhetoric they've heard online. \n\nBut believing in sustainability and ecopolitics does not make you an irrational, radical person.\n\nIn Germany, the Green party has risen to prominence as one of the largest parties in German democracy, even polling as the most popular for a brief amount of time.\n\nThis means that environmentalism is not a fringe, radical ideology. It has gone mainstream in a prestigious, well-developed country such as Germany, proving its value within our societies. \n\nGreen politics is no longer a heavily progressive, extremist following, but a unifying political affiliation. Built on the simple idea that we must do better for the future, it has attracted a wide, diverse voting base. It promotes a cultural unification and globalism. As a result, both young and old find themselves supporters of the German Green Party.\n\nFurthermore, it is no longer a respectable, logical stance to stand defiant against the wave of green support, and claim the facts are fraudulent. \n\nSome of the most esteemed and advanced scientific organisations have all come forward to acknowledge the existence of climate change, such as NASA, The Royal Society, Harvard, the United Nations, etc.\n\nIn a modern society, when one has access to the world's vast collective storage of information, it is unacceptable to deny climate change's existence when the evidence is everywhere.\n\nPerhaps you think that it's just a few degrees of change. That it'll only get a little hotter and a little colder.\n\nLet's say that the temperature changes by about 2 degrees. That's not much, right? If it were a normal day, then it would only be a little hotter, reminiscent of summer. \n\nIt very well could be, for you at least. As investigated by numerous scientific journals and research papers, we can expect a variance in temperature by 2 degrees to cause up to 1.5 months of heat waves. Furthermore, it would cause a 98% chance for an increase in coral bleaching, and a 16% reduction in wheat production, among other things.\n\nOnce again, perhaps you think that might not affect you. However, a 16% reduction in wheat means a lot for developing countries, where food is scarce. Imagine that there are a hundred people in a town, that are fed by 100 loaves of bread a day. If 16% of wheat production stop completely, then 16 loaves of bread wouldn't be produced.\n\nThus, 16 people go hungry.\n\nThey aren't the only ones who are impacted by this.\n\nSimply put, supply and demand means that low supply will increase prices. You could as far away from the physical effects of climate change as you like, but if 16% of the world's food supply disappears, then your wallet will suffer the increased price of basic foods.\n\nRecently, Australia went through a food supply crisis, when shortages, when the food supply chain broke down as a result of the pandemic.\n\nAlthough it wasn't caused by climate change, food supply shortages can even affect first world nations such as Australia.\n\nNow, perhaps you attribute green politics to socialism, and wholeheartedly believe that it goes against your conservative political views.\n\nI personally disagree, as I believe that environmentalism can be one of the most traditional ideologies out there.\n\nThe whole goal of ecopolitics is to **conserve** the natural world around us. \n\nTo ensure that the next generation and their children can enjoy the same world that we currently reside in. \n\nA world of beauty, passion, and freedom.\n\nSounds rather conservative, right?\n\nThus, it is irresponsible and irrational to think that sustainability is a radical, uncontrolled, deceitful ideology. It is essential that you truly believe and contribute to building a safe, sustainable global environment, before it's too late.\n\n#10ENG ","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/English-Visual-Text-Notes":{"title":"","content":"#10ENG \n\nTags: [[English Yr 11]]\n\nExposition:\n\nInitial scene: \n* Long shot\n\t* Useful for creating a sense of setting, gives you the view of the whole setting\n* Colour scheme is muted, gives the sense of something being sick\n* One silhouette \n* Empty, barren, nothing is growing, rocky, desolate\n* Gives the idea that the world left is now a barren wasteland\n\nThe 2 travellers:\n- Costuming\n\t- Doesn't look human\n\t- Costuming reinforces the barren aesthetic, i.e., gas mask \n- Short sequence when we move from desolate, then give clearer sense of what happened to nature\n\t- Nature appears lifeless, infested by something, like a fungal disease.\n\t- Abnormal growth\n\t\t- Why is it abnormal?\n\t\t\t- Texture, spider-web like\n\t\t\t- Spitting stuff out, purple is associated with disease, danger, e.g. poison is purple, purple mushrooms\n\nCamera pan:\n* Camera pan shows us the full devastation of the village\n* Now we see how the wasteland-like atmosphere has affected the houses\n\t* Houses overgrown, like the trees\n\n**WIND**\n* Since the start of the movie, we can predominantly hear the wind\n* Gives an eerie sense\n\nLittle doll\n- Human picks up the doll and it disintegrates\n- Whatever happened was not discriminant, affected even innocent people\n- Creates the uncomfortable sense that the catastrophe did not just affect a single population, but all of human kind\n\nClose-up on insect:\n* Weird tongue, scary red eyes\n* Makes it seem malevolent\n\nTapestry:\n* Tell a story of what happened to the earth\n* Artistic rendering of the giant warriors\n\nGiant warriors shot:\n* Body expression dehumanises them\n\t* Sinister eyes.

In the film, large metallic warships from the Tolmekian Empire aggressively attack the Valley of the Wind, smashing through a windmill. This emotionless destruction of the windmill symbolises the Tolmekian's strength and dominance over the Valley of the Wind, and their ideals of human connection with nature. Furthermore, the extensive symbolism of metal within the Tolmekian ranks highlights a lack of sympathy and attention to nature. This dehumanises the Tolmekians, presenting their relationship with metal and by extension technology as detrimental to nature. Thus, by utilising symbolism, the text represents two societies at odds regarding the prevalence of climate change.","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/Essential-Chemistry-Skills":{"title":"","content":"Status: \n\nTags: \n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/Friday":{"title":"","content":"**Friday Routine:**\n\n-   6am - Wake up, do the following for 1 hour:\n    -   **Eat breakfast - prioritise this**\n    -   Brush teeth\n    -   Shower\n    -   Prepare for school (check handbook)\n-   7am - Study for an hour\n-   8am - Leisure time for 15 minutes (oboe, piano, study, etc.)\n-   8.15am - Leave for school (30min)\n-   8.45am - School\n-   3.15pm - Attend and return from piano within **3 hours!!!**\n-   6.15pm - Eat dinner for an hour\n-   7.15pm: Study for an hour\n-   8.15pm - Take a break and wind down\n\nTags: #personalnotes ","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/History-of-the-Atomic-Model":{"title":"","content":"\n# History of the Atomic Model\n\n\n## Notes\n\n1.  **Democritus** (460 - 370 BCE) describes matter as **infinitely** divisible and proposes matter is made up for **tiny indivisible particles, with nothing between them but empty space.** He names these particles “Atomos”, which means “uncuttable or indivisible” in Greek.\n    \n2.  The term “element” is coined by **Robert Boyle**’s _The Sceptical Chymist_. Boyle defined an element as a substance that **could not decompose into other substances**. (Essentially indivisible).\n    \n3.  **Law of conservation of mass: Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier** conducts numerous experiments, such as heating tin to form ‘calxes’ (metal oxides). Lavoisier pioneered the use of precise numerical measurements, and concluded that there was **no change in mass** during a chemical reaction.\n    \n4.  **John Dalton:**\n    \n    (1803-1808)\n    \n    John Dalton came up with a theory of atomic matter:\n    \n    1.  Elements are composed of extremely small indivisible particles called atoms.\n    2.  All atoms of a given element are identical having the same size, mass and chemical properties. Atoms of different elements have a different size, mass and chemical properties.\n    3.  Atoms are not created nor destroyed or changed into different types during a chemical reaction.\n    4.  A chemical reaction involves only separation, combination or rearrangement of atoms.\n    5.  Compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine in a specific simple whole-number ratio.\n    \n    NOTE: Following a modern understanding of atomic structure, Points 1-2 and 5 are incorrect. Atoms can be divided into subatomic particles, Atoms of the same element may have different masses (isotopes), and elements do not always combine in the simplest whole-number ratios. (e.g. sucrose ($C_{11}H_{22}0_{11}$))\n    \n    **The law of definite proportions:**\n    \n    Dalton proposed: “compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine in a specific ratio.” This is true given our modern understanding of chemistry, as Calcium oxide, for example, will occur with Ca and O atoms in some fixed ratio\n    \n    **The law of conservation of mass:**\n    \n    Dalton proposed: “atoms are not created nor destroyed or changed into different types; a chemical reaction involves separation, combination or rearrangement of atoms.” Thus, there must be the same amount of atoms in the reactants of a chemical reaction as the atoms in the product.\n    \n    **The law of multiple proportions:**\n    \n    Dalton proposed: “Whenever two elements form more than one compound, the different masses of one element that combines with a fixed mass of the other element is always a whole number ratio.” 95% sure this is wrong\n    \n    Why is Dalton wrong?\n    \n    He had a rule of ‘greatest simplicity’, which made some of his calculations incorrect. He assumed water was HO, and ammonia NH. Because of this, his measurements for the weight of oxygen was wrong by half of its actual value. Similarly, he made no suggestions for the structure of the atom.\n    \n    Why is Dalton right?\n    \n    He identified elements as consisting of indestructible particles called atoms. Good on him, but his calculations were bad\n    \n5.  **J.J. Thomson:**\n    \n    (1897)\n    \n    J.J Thomson would pick up the work of Michael Faraday, who discovered the electrical properties of atoms. Working alongside other scientists (Julius Plucker, Sir William Crookes), he developed the **cathode ray**.\n    \n    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/603c64be-8d6d-4360-bfe7-8927aba4a658/Untitled.png)\n    \n    Essentially, a cathode (negative terminal) would release these rays towards the anode within a partially evacuated glass tube (cathode ray tube(CRT)). Cathode rays would cause gasses to glow like Neon in a sign. They found that a cathode ray can be affected by other negative/positive plates, and by a magnetic field.\n    \n    Thomson stated that the material of the cathode did not affect the cathode rays. He assumed that they were not a form of radiation but negatively charged particles with some mass. These particles were electrons, which is why Thomson is credited with their discovery.\n    \n    Thomson used both properties of cathode rays, being that they are deflected by both magnetic fields and charged metal plates, to adjust the strengths of both tools so the cathode rays would be unaffected. This would allow Thomson to determine the charge to mass ratio ($q_e/m_e$) for the cathode ray particles (electrons). The ratio he determined was about $1.76 \\times 10^{-8}$ coulombs per gram. Knowing the charge to mass ratio of aqueous ions, Thomson estimated the mass of an electron to be less than a thousandth the mass of the lightest atom, Hydrogen.\n    \n    This proved that **atoms must be divisible.**\n    \n    Later on, Robert Millikan used Thomson’s charge to mass ratio to find the mass of an atom, $9.11 \\times 10^{-31}$ kg, which is 1/1800 of the mass of a hydrogen atom.\n    \n    Thomson’s model of the atom was pretty weird.\n    \n    At that time, it was known that matter was made up of atoms, which was electrically neutral.\n    \n    It was also known that there were negatively charged particle known as electrons, with a very small fraction of the size of an actual atom.\n    \n    So, Thomson proposed the plum pudding model, where negatively charged electrons were embedded within a larger uniformly positively charged sphere, like plums in plum pudding. This sphere would account for the majority of an atom’s mass.\n    \n    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/5053cee3-8a3f-4fed-89d5-1bc9de1f56cd/Untitled.png)\n    \n    **Other stuff:**\n    \n    (1906)\n    \n    Thomson used positive rays to discover Neon in 2 different types of atoms (its charge/mass ratio was different). Thus, he discovered isotopes in a stable element.\n    \n6.  **Ernest Rutherford:**\n    \n    (1911)\n    \n    Rutherford, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, use alpha particles (2+ charged helium nuclei, literally helium without its electrons) on gold foil.\n    \n    Assuming Thomson’s model was correct, positively charged alpha particles would pass through the gold foil with little or no deflection, **because** the positive charge/mass would be thinly and uniformly spread out across the atom.\n    \n    explanation of gold foil experiment\n    \n    The Gold foil experiment found that most alpha-particles incurred no deflection, however some alpha particles were greatly deflected, even back into their own direction.\n    \n    Thus, Thomson’s model was disproven, as the deflection suggested a variance in the mass of an atom, with the majority of mass being concentrated in an area.\n    \n    Rutherford proposed a new model, with an atom consisting of mostly empty space occupied by electrons, which orbited a tiny central region known as a **nucleus**. In this model, all positive charge is in the nucleus and all negative charge is found in the electrons. This explains why the alpha particles were so greatly deflected, as although most particles passed through the empty space, some particles would go close or impact the dense and positively charged nucleus, which would deflect them.\n    \n7.  **Niels Bohr**\n    \n    (1913)\n    \n    Rutherford’s model also did not account for **emissions spectra (aka line spectra)**. Low pressure gasses and vaporised elements would produce these spectra when excited by electricity.\n    \n    Similarly, based on classical physics, an electron constantly moving around would cause it to radiate energy, losing its energy and speed as it is pulled into the nucleus. This would mean **all atoms are unstable,** **which is wrong.**\n    \n    Niels Bohr applied quantum theory to solve this problem with unstable electron orbits and accounted for the emissions spectra.\n    \n    He proposed that electrons **moved around** the nucleus in circular orbits, however there were only specific orbital radii. He also assumed that an electron in an orbit would have a specific amount (quanta) of energy, where the closest orbital to the nucleus would have the least amount of energy.\n    \n    He also hypothesised that a photon would be emitted from an excited electron, which was an electron not at its ground state, which is the lowest possible **electron quantum level** (energy states), as it fell to a lower energy orbit. **NOTE: The energy of the photon is equal to the difference in energy between the 2 orbits.** The frequency of the photon could be determined using the formula $E_{photon} = hf$, where $h$ = $6.626\\times10^{-34}$ and $f$ = frequency. However, Bohr went against classical physics by proposing that electrons would orbit a nucleus without losing energy.\n    \n    Thus, Bohr determined the energy associated with each of the electron energy states of the hydrogen atom. Using this, Bohr could calculate the wavelengths of light that corresponded to the emissions spectra of hydrogen. He was pretty correct.\n    \n    Bohr’s model accurately described emissions spectra. Similarly, it explained the formation of absorption spectra, as electrons would only allow photons of a specific energy that corresponded to the difference between the energy state it would move to and its current one to excite them. The electrons would absorb the photons, but not the ones that weren’t the right energy. This created the absorption spectra, which outlined the wavelengths of visible light that were absorbed.\n    \n    Bohr’s model describes the electron’s smallest orbit corresponds to its lowest energy state, which he called the ground state. Because of this, Bohr established atomic stability, as the electrons won’t crash into the nucleus given they cant go below the ground state, which will always be a positive radius from the nucleus.\n    \n8.  **Erwin Schrödinger:**\n    \n    (1926 - Early 20s)\n    \n    Bohr’s model had some issues, because there was no reason for electron orbits to be quantised, and no reason for “atomic stability” (wow lucarelli, very descriptive, it essentially asks why the ground state orbit was the lowest energy state for the electron(ground state = $E_1$)). Also, it could not successfully predict the emissions spectrum of atoms that had more than one electron. (It could only predict emissions spectrum for $H$, $He^+$, $Li^{2+}$, etc.)\n    \n    (1924)\n    \n    Sidenote: During the early 20s, **Louis de Broglie** proposed that electrons could have a wave and particle nature, much like light acting like a particle and a wave.\n    \n    This wave nature would explain the discrete (quantised) energy **states**.\n    \n    Because of this, Schrödinger and **Werner Heisenberg** developed a new quantum mechanical theory for the electronic structure of the atom, the **Wave mechanical model.**\n    \n    In their model of the atom, electrons do not orbit the nucleus, instead Schrödinger treated them as mathematical waves. Schrödinger’s model is purely based on quantum ideas. Electrons had a probability of being found at a certain position. In this model, electrons don’t have specific path, but a probability of being in a location at a specific time. (sounds a lot like quantum physics because it is :)) Rather than neat, clean orbitals, Schrödinger’s model proposed electrons inhabited a “cloud”, and where the cloud is most dense is the most likely place to find an electron. - suborbital levels now exist, also the cloud has 99.99999% of the atom’s volume, but literally none of its actual mass.\n\n9.  **Sir James Chadwick:**\n    \n    (1932)\n    \n    Rutherford’s model did not account for all the mass. Data from Hans Geiger and Ernst Marden showed that the mass of protons in the nucleus was half the atom’s mass. This meant that, at best, protons accounted for half an atom’s overall mass. Thus, some neutral particles must be present somewhere in the nucleus (they knew it wasn’t in the electrons, because mass was concentrated in the nucleus).\n    \n    Chadwick found neutrons as a by-product of the bombardment of Beryllium with alpha particles.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/History-of-the-Atomic-Model-Notes":{"title":"","content":"\n# History of the Atomic Model\n\n**Democritus** (460 - 370 BCE) describes matter as **infinitely** divisible and proposes matter is made up for **tiny indivisible particles, with nothing between them but empty space.** He names these particles “Atomos”, which means “uncuttable or indivisible” in Greek.\n    \nThe term “element” is coined by **Robert Boyle**’s _The Sceptical Chymist_.

In this book, he established that orderings of atomic weights could be used to create **groupings**. \n\nHis goal was to create an ordered system to break down and make sense of the chemical/properties of elements known at the time, which were disjointed and confusing.\n\nGoing on, he would state that \"elements arranged accordingly to the value of their atomic weights presents a clear periodicity of properties\". This is where the “period” in “periodic table” comes from. Essentially, he correlated atomic weight to **valency**.\n\n```He could correlate valency as John Newlands had discovered the Law of Octaves, stating that every 8th element has similar behaviours to one another.```\n\nBased on his calculations, Mendeleev created an elaborate table, with spots for undiscovered elements and even suggestions for the correct values of atomic weight of certain elements. \n\nThis table would be validated due to the discovery of gallium, scandium, and germanium (1875-1886), which fit into Mendeleev's periodic table.\n\n**J.J.

Thus, some neutral particles must be present somewhere in the nucleus (they knew it wasn’t in the electrons, because mass was concentrated in the nucleus).\n\t\nChadwick found neutrons as a by-product of the bombardment of Beryllium with alpha particles.\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/How-to-write-a-good-method":{"title":"","content":"\n*20220312 1633*\n\n\nStatus: #11AECHE_PermanentNotes \n\nTags: [[notes/Separation Techniques]]\n\n\n# How to write a good method\n\n\n## Notes\n#### A good method:\n-   **Is a numbered list of instructions, not a description or explanation.**\n-   **Makes clear the order in which things happen.**\n-   **States what equipment is used at each stage**\n-   **Gives quantities where required.**\n-   **Makes sense to another human!**\n\n\ni still dont know how to write a good method\n\n# :)\n\n---\n## Recall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Summary","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/Hydrocarbons":{"title":"","content":"*Date: 2022 05 08 Time: 20:34*\n\n\nStatus: #11AECHE_PermanentNotes #10SCI_ChemNotes \n\nTags: \n\n\n# Hydrocarbons\n\nhell no im not going through each of the photos and copying them over\n\nhttps://occipital-kryptops-438.notion.site/Hydrocarbons-0b40bea8bb5f4ff590638601c9e3f1c8","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/Intermolecular-Forces":{"title":"","content":"Status: \n\nTags: \n\n![[notes/aww yea baby yr 12 examination lets goooo.png]]","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/Introduction-to-Bonding":{"title":"","content":"Status: \n\nTags: ","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/Ionic-Bonding":{"title":"","content":"Status: \n\nTags: ","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/Join-if-you-want-aids":{"title":"","content":"*Date: 20220416 Time: 1858*\n\nStatus: #idea \n\nTags:\n\n# Join if you want aids\n\n\n[https://discord.gg/ecPkMjdexf](https://discord.gg/ecPkMjdexf \"https://discord.gg/ecPkMjdexf\")\n\nthe quotes are so funny they give me a headache\n\n---\n\n# References\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Ababou\nhttps://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-e-g-Mohammed-Ababou-and-his-cult-still-believe-that-numbers-are-finite-or-is-it-just-satire\n\n![[Pasted image 20220416190849.png]]\n\nwtf do these words mean","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/Lit-Language-Features-Glossary":{"title":"","content":"\nStatus: #10LIT\n\nTags:\n\n# Lit Language Features Glossary\n\n| Language feature    | Description                                                                                     |\n| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| figurative language | words or phrases that are meaningful, but not literally true                                    |\n| metaphor            | when a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable |\n| simile              | comparing two things of different kinds, makes descriptions more vivid                          |\n| personification     | attributing personal nature to something non-human                                              |\n| imagery             | visually descriptive language                                                                   |\n| sound               | imagery that appeals to the sense of hearing                                                    |\n| visual              | using visual qualities to create an image                                                                                                |\n| tactile             | imagery describing how things feel to the touch                                                                                                |\n| symbolism           |                                                                                                 |\n| speaker/persona     |                                                                                                 |\n| form                |                                                                                                 |\n| rhythm/meter        |                                                                                                 |\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Extract":{"title":"","content":"Status: #10LIT \n\n**Chapter 1: Solace**\n\nTears of dew silently fell from the azure clouds, gently carried by the dance of zephyrs. At last, Columbia had reached the riparian of the lake. She dipped her hands into the water. A bolt of frost shot through her arms, the perspiration of the clouds immediately deepened as the blue above darkened, and divine light struck the lake. Columbia fell away from the water in shock, as the breeze started pushing her into the arms of the forest. She could hear the winds cry out in pain, the once still lake erupting in violent gushes. The wails quickly turned dormant, as the wind halted, and the lake became silent once again. \n\nLooking down at her chest, Columbia drew her attention to the eloquent dances of a fine garnet gem, projecting an aura of grandiose as the centrepiece of the necklace around her neck. It was a gift from her parents, a symbol of their love for her before their untimely murder. Holding back her tears as fond memories of her parents flooded her thoughts, Columbia quaintly moved her fingers towards the gem.\n\nImmediately as the tip of her fingers made contact with the gleaming gem, a wave of pain rippled through her mind, like blades of steel puncturing her head.  A raw layer of maroon exuded into her vision, as her other sensations dimmed. Columbia fell to the floor, an unknown force crushing her breath deep down her throat. However, as quickly as the pain shot through her head, it disappeared. Columbia opened her eyes, making out her distorted, liminal surroundings through her blood-red vision. A sense of confusion struck Columbia, only to be soothed by a voice she hadn't heard in years.\n\nColumbia turned around to see her father. She saw him clench his rifle tightly. He had been expecting an attack from the British ever since Madison's Congress declared war. When their eyes met, a shard of sadness pierced her heart. To Columbia's disappointment, there was no compassion in the cloudy, glass spheres resting within his eye sockets. With his mouth wide open, he charged into the forest, with Columbia following closely. Dashing through the loose leaves and branches, Columbia kept her eyes trained on the figure of her father as gunshots rang out around her. At last, a final, deafening shot oscillated throughout the stale air. Columbia stopped to see her father clasp his chest, with an achromatic liquid discharged into his palms. He quickly rummaged through his left pocket to pull out a silvery locket. Columbia was shocked to see a faint picture of her alongside her father within. With tears flowing from her eyes, Columbia quietly observed as her father pulled the locket close to his chest, as the life faded from his body. As raw emotion overwhelmed Columbia, she fell to the ground as her father vanished, sobbing furiously.\n\nIn the distance, the anxious murmurs of forest wildlife were interrupted by a dissonant shriek. Columbia looked up to see herself on the bank of the lake in the embrace of her mother, surrounded by a group of British soldiers. Although she was a great distance away from the scene, Columbia could hear her mother comfort her, with words she had forgotten. \"I'm sorry, my precious daughter. I've failed you. I've failed as your mother, your caregiver, and your creator. I won't be able to help you in your journey through life. If my sacrifice today leads to your survival, then it is the least I can do. Now get in the boat, and leave.\" Columbia tearfully watched herself climb into the boat, as her mother let the soldiers slash at her with their swords. Glancing over, Columbia saw herself frantically setting sail to her fragile boat, drifting off into the distance. But unlike what she remembered, she watched wordlessly as the Columbia in the boat was swallowed by the waves of the lake. A tide of water pummelled over her head, reaching at her throat with cold, forceful hands. Before losing her breath, Columbia felt the sharp metallic edges of the necklace's chain grazing her skin. Pushing against the water, she tore the necklace off her neck.\n\nColumbia felt the coarse sand on her back and stood up to see the necklace in the palm of her hand, and her feet planted at the shore of the lake. She was relieved to see the crimson in her vision had lifted. She clenched her fist and threw the necklace into the deep end of the water, watching as it elegantly sank like a stone. Tears of comfort fell from Columbia's eyes, as she came to the realisation that her parents wanted her to be happy, and died for her. Although the burden of their deaths still laid heavy on her shoulder, she was ready to move on. She dived into the lake, and with fluidity floated gently at the surface.","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/Literature-In-Class-Essay-+-Planning":{"title":"","content":"\n# Literature In Class Essay\n\nWorks of literature are often classified into genres based on similar themes and tropes, but unique aspects of texts set them apart from their genre. \"The Hunger Games\" (2008) by Suzanne Collins is a young adult romantic novel that follows Katniss Everdeen's experience as a tribute of the Hunger Games, a televised event where tributes must kill each other to win. Produced at the height of American societal anxiety over conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan, the text is recognisably dystopian, but undermines past dystopian themes as it adapts to the young adult fiction genre. The text conforms to dystopian tropes in its presentation of an oppressive and unequal society, where fear and apathy towards hope for positive societal change keeps its citizens reticent. However, Collins subverts the traditional dystopian genre by presenting the stability of Panem's totalitarian regime as waning, and through portraying humane, emotional ideas not commonly explored in established dystopian literature, such as love and social relationships. \n\nThrough imagery and passive diction, Collins adheres to the dystopian genre by presenting how the citizens of Panem are conditioned to submit to their oppression. Collins contrasts the apathy of District 12 for freedom from the authoritarian state with the lack of physical resistance to escape, conforming to the strongly dystopian theme of society giving way to oppression by means of neglect and indifference towards oppression. In the text, Katniss informs readers of the security surrounding District 12, describing a \"high chain-linked fence topped with barbed-wire loops\", that separates District 12 from the outside world. The use of visual imagery for the wall highlights the power of the Capitol, while disempowering the citizens of District 12, as they submit to the removal of their fundamental freedom of movement. Collins utilizes the wall as a symbol of tyranny to reinforce the dystopian nature of Panem's society, and the power imbalance between government and the people. In a modern society where free movement is commonplace, the idea of a wall strikes fear and concern in readers such as myself, unlike the citizens of District 12 who have been desensitised to their lack of freedom. Furthermore, Collins conveys the dejected attitude of those selected for the Hunger Games, when Katniss retells how \"we are taken into custody. I don't mean we're handcuffed or anything\". Katniss' colloquial diction, through nonchalantly saying \"or anything\", implores readers to contemplate the presentation of law and order in Panem. Katniss' compliance with being forced into the Hunger Games without handcuffs presents how hopeless tributes like Katniss are for their situation. In contemporary context, this scenario would be risible as one would expect violent physical opposition to such injustice, however Katniss' apathy to her fate upholds the dystopian trope of citizens blindly accepting misjustice. Thus, through the use of dialogue and imagery, Collins' text conforms to the dystopian genre in its portrayal of a defunct society, where the citizens of District 12 can not imagine a world without Panem's oppressive government.\n\nCollins utilizes character voice of the protagonist and side characters to present Panem's social order as strong, but giving way to unrest and upheaval, subverting the dystopian trope of a stable government. Katniss recounts to the audience the universal resentment towards the Capitol, describing how \"not one person claps... they take part in the boldest form of dissent... Silence. Which says we do not agree. We do not condone. All of this is wrong.\" The auditory imagery of the silence conveyed through short, sharp syntax highlights how unpopular the Panem's government is. This presentation of unopposed public protest undermines the dystopian nature of Panem, confusing readers such as myself, who envision dystopian societies as one where loyalty to the state must be demonstrated at all time, and where acts of protest such as this would evoke immediate punishment. After Rue's death, Katniss emotionally states how \"It's the Capitol I hate, for doing this to all of us\". Through emotive words such as \"hate\", Katniss conveys to readers her hatred for the Capitol, presenting to audiences the atmosphere of discontent with the Capitol's oppressive rule. This subverts traditional dystopian texts, by disempowering Panem's government and its stability as an authoritarian regime. In presenting the people of Panem as disapproving, Collins appeals to a young adult audience, by romanticizing revolution and discontent against government and engaging teenage audiences through the promise of action. Thus, through using character voice, Collins undermines the dystopian genre by presenting an unhappy population, and presenting the Capitol's control over the people's emotions as weak.\n\nIn highlighting Katniss' emotions through dialogue and characterization, Collins subverts traditional dystopian texts in their focus on life as a citizen in a totalitarian, dystopian society, by instead focusing on more emotional themes, such as love and social relationships. Peeta tells Katniss \"we're madly in love, so it's all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it.\" The use of affectionate diction surprises audiences, as it subverts expectations of a dystopian text. The idea that raw love can be so easily expressed in a ruthless, oppressive society such as Panem starkly contrasts dystopias where love is viewed as dangerous and sometimes illegal. This presentation of romance appeals to contemporary audiences, who live in societies where freely expressing love is a social norm. In the text, Katniss details her attitude towards children in the community home, describing how \"I could never let that happen to Prim. Sweet, tiny Prim\". This contemplative and affectionate epistrophe characterises Katniss as caring for her sister like she was her mother. This explores their unique sororal relationship, which is unusual in a dystopian text, where it is conventional for there to be  a lack of individualism. In doing so, Collins subverts dystopian norms centred around the extent of totalitarianism in society, by presenting elements of love and emotion. As someone who reads the Hunger Games as modernist and liberal in its interpretation of the dystopian genre, I react with approval to Collins' humane representation of love in the text, and her appeal to the young adult audience. Thus, by utilizing characterization and diction, Collins aligns to the traditional portrayals of gender expected in conventional dystopian texts, but her inclusion of romance explores the scope of the dystopian genre, undermining founding dystopian texts.\n\nThrough symbolism, dialogue, characterisation and voice, Collins constructs a recognisably dystopian text that both conforms and subverts the dystopian genre. The society is dystopian in how it propagates apathy towards suffering, and the Panem government's totalitarian rule, yet its portrayal of a dissident, spiteful population and its unique representation of gender and romance subverts ideas found in texts such as George Orwell's \"1984\". In undermining traditional dystopian tropes, Collins intends to explore new perspectives of dystopian conventions, and modernises the genre for contemporary audiences. The text is an excellent example of a postmodernist work that revitalises traditional genres, in its incorporation of modern characteristics of text.\n\n**Quotes**\n- \"The moment the anthem ends, we are taken into custody.

In using a short story style for my extract, I was able to vividly portray an individual's experience, and in doing so I could effectively write romantically, as I was able to include figurative devices and prevalent ideas of the Romantic era more freely within my text. The language of my piece draws heavy inspiration from the core themes of Romanticism, specifically its admiration of nature, and use of the supernatural. Furthermore, I use imagery frequently to immerse the reader, such as in the opening line \"Tears of dew silently fell from the azure clouds, gently carried by the dance of zephyrs.\" This use of language is common in Romantic pieces, such as in Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. I intended for my overall anthology to be read by students of the Romantic era. My intention was that my story would give audiences fresh insight into the experience of individuals who fall victim to war. I hoped to present war as a tragedy of the human experience, and to portray those affected by war as deserving of more sympathy. I based my extract on the context of the Romantic era, a turbulent time in history that suffered through a plethora of wars. While I have not use specific texts as inspiration, I have chosen to discuss my own personal opinions towards war, a theme prevalent throughout the Romantic era, in a style expected of the Romantic era.","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Romanticism-Overview":{"title":"","content":"*Date: 2022 06 20 Time: 09:07*\n\nStatus: #10LIT\n\nTags:\n\n# Literature Romanticism Overview\n\n#### Origins\n\nRomanticism is a movement within both art and literature throughout the 18th to 19th century. It came about as a form of revolution against the previous Neoclassical movement prevalent in Europe within the 17th to 18th centuries, which promoted a return to classical Greek and Roman artistic elements.\n\n```ad-quote\n**\"literature depicting emotional matter in an imaginative form\"**\n- *Friedrich Schlegel* in regards to romantic literature (from *Athenäeum-Fragment*, 1798)\n```\n\n#### Prevailing principles\n\nPrimarily, romantic writers focused on the exploration of individuality, spirituality, nature, and sometimes an appreciation of isolationism as core tenants of their literature. \n\nIn terms of literary devices, personification and pathetic fallacy were heavily utilised as a byproduct of Romanticism's greater focus on nature. Karl von Martius, an early Romantic author, used such techniques in his volume report *Flora Brasiliensis*:\n\n```ad-quote\n**\"Even today those trees speak to me and fill my spirit with a certain pious fear,\"**\n- Karl von Martius, *Flora Brasiliensis* (1840)\n\n```\n\n#### Figures of importance\n\n| Author                  | Famous Work                            |\n| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| William Wordsworth      | \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\"         |\n| Samuel Taylor Coleridge | \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\"      |\n| Percy Bysshe Shelley    | \"To a Skylark\"                         |\n| William Blake           | \"Songs of Innocence and of Experience\" |\n| John Keats              | \"Ode to a Nightingale\"                         |\n| Mary Shelly             | \"Frankenstein\"                                        |\n\n## References:\n- https://www.thoughtco.com/romanticism-definition-4777449#:~:text=Characteristics%20of%20Romanticism,and%20personification%20and%20pathetic%20fallacy.\n- https://uh.edu/engines/romanticism/introduction.html\n- https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schlegel/#LifWor\n- https://green.harvard.edu/news/intertwining-romanticism-and-science-through-metaphor#:~:text=In%20the%20late%20eighteenth%20and,worldview%20(New%20World%20Encyclopedia).\n- https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Karl_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Von_Schlegel#School_of_Romanticism\n- https://archive.org/details/athenaeum06unkngoog/page/n13/mode/2up\n- https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/roma/hd_roma.htm#:~:text=Romanticism%2C%20first%20defined%20as%20an,and%20flourished%20until%20mid%2Dcentury.\n- https://blog.artsper.com/en/a-closer-look/an-introduction-to-romanticism/#:~:text=Romanticism%20started%20in%20Western%20Europe,the%20promotion%20of%20ideal%20values.\n- https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literary-movements/british-romanticism/authors","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/Markdown-Resources":{"title":"","content":"\nhttps://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#paragraphs-1\n\nhttps://www.markdownguide.org/tools/obsidian/\n\nhttps://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Basic+note+taking\n\nhttps://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/\n\nhttps://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/Math-Working-Out":{"title":"","content":"\n\n$f(x) = \\frac{wx}{x^2+b(w+b)}$\n\n$f(\\frac{g(x)}{h(x)})=\\frac{h(x)g'(x)-g(x)h'(x)}{h(x)^2}$\n\n$\\therefore f'(x) = \\frac{(x^{2}+b(w+b)) \\times w -

  Nano - Particles larger than individual atoms, but smaller than the wavelength of light, thus cannot be viewed through optical microscopes\n-   Nanoscale: structures that are between 1 - 100 nanometers across.\n    -   Nanometer (nm): $10^{-9}$ m wide\n-   **Nanomaterials:** substances that can be both natural and synthetic, that are composed of single units that exist in the nanoscale.\n-   **Family of carbon molecules called fullerenes!!**\n    -   3 dimensional structures formed by networks of carbon\n    -   Most prominent one is one that forms a cylindrical tube called **carbon nanotube**\n        -   Formed from a flat, 2-dimension layer of carbon atoms arranged in hexagons, known as graphene.\n    -   Carbon nanotubes are really strong and stiff\n-   **Top-down fabrication:**\n    -   Starts with material of a larger scale than desire, which is selectively removed or the size of the material is progressively reduced, by grinding, until the required size and shape is achieved.\n    -   Most commonly used technique for manufacturing\n    -   **Advantages:**\n        -   Large quantities of material can be produced\n        -   Very cheap\n        -   Decent uniformity\n    -   **Disadvantages:**\n        -   Limited to simplicity\n        -   Limited to scale of tools (how precise can it be?)\n-   **Bottom-up fabrication:**\n    -   Physically growing, or building, materials atom by atom/molecule by molecule.\n    -   Like chemical syntheses, but on a nanoscale.\n    -   ‘Self-assembling’ nanomaterials?\n-   **Nanoparticles:**\n    -   A specific type of nanomaterials, usually spherical particles with diameters of about 1-100 nm.\n    -   In this size range, **properties** start to change. e.g. Gold is usually golden, but in nanoparticles it can take numerous colours.\n-   Normally sunscreens contain metal oxides, however when zinc nanoparticles are used, they interact with light differently and appear clear.\n-   **Colloids:**\n    -   A mixture where one insoluble substance is dispersed in another. Colloids contain particles on the nanoscale that do not settle out of the mixture over time.\n    -   A homogeneous non-crystalline substance consisting of large molecules or ultramicroscopic particles of one substance dispersed through a second substance\n\n**4.4 Metallic Nanomaterials:**\n\n-   Consist of metal ions arranged to make structures that have **at least 1 dimension** in in the nanometre scale (1 - 100 nm)\n\n\n\nLucarelli :)\n\n8.9: Fullerenes:\n\n-   A recently discovered allotropic form of carbon.\n-   A new group of fullerenes, Carbon Nanotubes was discovered in Japan.\n-   **Fullerenes:** Three-dimensional structures formed by networks of carbon atoms.\n-   Visualise carbon nanotubes as a graphene sheet rolled into a cylinder shape.\n    -   Ends of CNTs are usually open or capped off using a hemispherical arrangement of carbon atoms bonded into interlocking pentagon and hexagon arrangements.\n    -   CNTs are $1\\times10^{-9}$m or 1 nanometre wide by diameter, but can be as long as several micrometres - a thousandth of a millimeter, $1 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n    -   CNTs can have an unlimited length, and can be produced with multiple walls with multiple concentric CNTs with increasing diameter being fit into one another. (**Multi Walled Nanotubes (MWNTs)**)\n    -   Atoms in CNTs are bonded through covalent bonds, giving CNTs a lot of strength/flexibility.\n    -   They are also very light as they are comprised of carbon. This creates a super-strong lightweight material.\n    -   CNTs also have weird electrical properties.\n        -   Used as semiconductors/conductors.\n        -   Can conduct 1000 times better than copper and silver.\n        -   They can conduct with little to no heating effect (radiation emitted?)\n        -   This means CNTs have a lot of potential for electrical devises.\n-   Fullerenes have a lot of surface area, and can be molecular containers. They also bond to surfaces and other structures really well.\n-   Thus, they have many applications\n-   **Nanotechnology:** A new field of scientific endeavour focused on the study and potential application of fullerenes, nanoparticles and other similar structures.\n\n8.10 Nanotechnology:\n\n-   **Nanoparticles:** Particles with at least one dimension in the 1-100 nanometre range.\n-   Nanoparticles have **unique properties** due to **quantum effects,** as a result of a **small particle size**.\n-   For example, Zinc and Titanium oxide are commonly used in sunscreen and cosmetics.\n    -   In general, they are used as **“macro particles”**. This means small particles but larger than nanoparticles.\n        -   This makes a visible white opaque layer!\n    -   Instead, using $ZnO$ and $TiO_2$ as nanoparticles allows for a **quantum effect**, as they become **invisible** while still absorbing UV.\n-   **In general,** these **quantum effects** greatly impact **optical properties.**\n    -   This is because nanoparticles, with their quantum effects, interact differently with light.\n-   However, differently sized nanoparticles also can produce unique properties.\n-   For example, Cadmium Selenide as a nanoparticle will produce different visible light when UV light is shone onto a solution containing them.\n-   These particles are known as “**quantum dots**”.\n    -   (They affect the wavelength of light, with smaller dots producing shorter wavelengths and vice versa.)\n-   CNTs also have electrical properties that differ from Carbon’s.\n-   These electrical properties make it a really good conductor and semiconductor, allowing computers to be compacted further as semiconductors are built within a nanometre’s range.\n-   Silver has many antibacterial and antifungal effects, which is further enhanced when used in **nanoparticle form.**\n    -   This is due to an increase in surface area, a common property of fullerenes.\n-   **Nanodevice research!!!** - uses in medical field, e.g. for diagnosis/detection/treatment of cancer\n-   **Dendrimers** - nanosized nanoparticle structures\n-   They can be designed as molecular carriers, which can carry molecules that recognise cancer, kill cancers, recognise a dead cancer cell, signal a cancer cell’s death, etc.\n-   Using dendrimers in this fashion, one can kill cancer cells, while reporting its efficiency.\n    -   NOTE: This would mean literally no side effects, as its only killing cancer (the bad stuff) and doesn’t work like radiation which also kills healthy cells (the good stuff)\n-   These devices are called **therapeutic nanodevices**, and use **quantum dots, nanoshells and nanopores**.\n\n8.11 Nanocomposites.\n\n-   Nanoparticles have been around for a long time, despite nanotechnology being very new.\n-   Carbon black(soot), an amorphous form of carbon is largely comprised of carbon particles in the nanometre range.\n    -   Used as an additive in rubber for tyres, as its really strong. Tyres have 25% of its rubber made of carbon black.\n    -   More amounts of carbon black will make the rubber more conductive, preventing build-ups of static electricity. - useful to prevent accidents.\n-   **Nanocomposites:** Materials created by adding nanosized particles of one material to a matrix of a bulk material (metal, polymer, ceramics(recall Pearson))\n-   Nanocomposites have numerous advantages and more useful properties:\n    -   Mechanical strength\n    -   Electrical/thermal conductivity\n    -   Optical properties\n-   Used in manufacturing of plastics - nanotubes or graphene is added.\n-   1-5% concentration of nanoparticles in nanocomposites can increase stiffness by 50%, and mechanical strength by 20%\n-   They slow down cracks from forming as they have high tensile strength.\n-   Can be used in lithium ion batteries - comprised of electrodes, which are usually made of graphite - carbon nanotubes, graphene sheets and nanocomposites have been suggested as replacements.\n    -   Carbon-silicon nanocomposite material seems to be promising\n    -   Silicon has good energy storage, but breaks down as it contracts and expands when charges are discharged.\n    -   This is where nanoparticles of carbon come in, as they can maintain a rigid structure, while still having the high energy storage of silicon.\n\n**Examples of Nanomaterials:**\n\n-   Carbon\n-   Gold\n-   Silver\n-   Zinc Oxide\n-   Cadmium selenide\n-   Titanium oxide\n-   Amorphous silica ($SiO_2$)\n-   Copper\n-   Iron\n\n**Advantages of nanomaterials: have been listed above**\n\n**Disadvantages of nanomaterials:**\n\n-   SAFETY CONCERNS:\n    -   **important rule: the properties of nanoparticles differ from the parent material in bulk form.**\n        -   e.g. glass fibre particles are very harmful, and brick workers use breathing masks to prevent exposure. In contrast, glass in bulk form is inert and harmless.\n-   Very hard to make:\n    -   **The production of nanomaterials requires a complex design and production infrastructure. There are numerous means to create nanoparticles, however they are usually very expensive and exclusive.**\n\n**WACE Study Guide Review:**\n* In general, the properties (physical + chemical) of bulk materials remains constant regardless of size.\n* However, as particle size becomes small, then properties can change drastically.\n\n- A nanoparticle is a particle that has at least 1 dimension within the nanoscale (1 - 100 nm (1 nm -\u003e $1 \\times 10^{-9}$m)).\n\n- **Nanotechnology**: \n\t- As particle size decreases, surface area greatly increases.\n\t- This means that more atoms/molecules can interact.\n\t- Reactivity is generally higher in nanoparticles due to their larger surface area, creating unique properties, that are very different in their macro particle form.\n\t- Light has a wavelength of around 500 nanometres. This means that photons are significantly larger than nanoparticles, which can exist in dimensions as small as 1 nanometre.\n\t\t- This means that light simply passes through nanomaterials, and **do not reflect**.\n\t- This is called a **quantum effect**. Essentially, due to their very small size, nanoparticles interact uniquely with particles of radiation, like light (electromagnetic).\n\t- Other forms of quantum effects exist. *Cadmium selenide* produces different types of coloured light depending on particle size while being in a solution.\n\t\t- This is different to macro particles of *Cadmium selenide*, which is insoluble and does not exhibit this range of colours.\n\t- Applications of nanotechnology include:\n\t\t- Sunscreens\n\t\t\t- Zinc oxide in its macro particle form is an effective absorber of UV light, which is why it is commonly used in sunscreens.\n\t\t\t- However, zinc oxide in its macro particle form is also a white, opaque substance.\n\t\t\t- Zinc oxide as nanoparticles becomes *transparent*, as a result of a unique **quantum effect**.\n\t\t- Special surfaces and coatings\n\t\t- Nanocomposite materials\n\t\t- Medicine\n\t- However, it is important to be aware of certain safety issues and regulations.\n\n\n[https://www.dummies.com/article/academics-the-arts/science/nanotechnology/why-you-want-nanotechnology-in-your-life-198989](https://www.dummies.com/article/academics-the-arts/science/nanotechnology/why-you-want-nanotechnology-in-your-life-198989)\n\n[[IJSO_Bohr__Spectra_and_the_Quantum_Atom_4.pdf]]\n\n\n---\n## Recall\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/Number-Sets-Notes":{"title":"","content":"\n# Number Sets Notes\n\nHere is a pretty good set diagram I stole from the internet:\n(for now we ignore the complex stuff, its in the next part)\n\u003cimg src=\"https://edsobsidiannotes.netlify.app/assets/Pasted image 20220422081915.png\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\"\u003e\n\nThese are all the subsets for the **real** numbers\n```ad-note\n-   Real numbers: A value of a continuous quantity that can be represented as a distance on a line.\n    -   Note: continuous, as real numbers include 1 and 0.1357108375103759831...\n\n```\n\nWithin all the **real** numbers exists numerous **subsets** of numbers.\n\nThese are the definitions for all the subsets, starting from the \"smallest\":\n\n**Natural/Counting Numbers:**\n\nNumbers which are used for counting.\n\nAsk your teacher whether it starts at 0 or 1, however from those numbers they increase by 1 all the way to infinity, e.g. :\n\n$1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 \\ ... \\ \\infty$\n\nNotice that this set does not include negative numbers (or 0).\n\n```ad-note\n\nSide-Note: There are 2 accepted definitions of natural numbers:\n    -   Traditional: Natural = set of positive integers {1,2,3...}\n    -   Slightly new: Natural = set of non-negative integers {0,1,2,3...}\n```\n\nThe range of all natural numbers goes from {$1, \\infty$}\n\n(or $0, \\infty$)\n\n**Integers:**\n\nWhole numbers, **OR**\nFraction that can be simplified, so that the denominator is 1.\n\ne.g. -42/2 is an integer, as it can be simplified to -21.

Let’s use a proof by contradiction.\n\nAssume $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational. All rational numbers can be written in the form $\\frac{p}{q}$ , where there are no common factors.\n\nTherefore:\n\n$(\\sqrt{2})^2 = (\\frac{p}{q})^2$\n\n$2 = \\frac{p^2}{q^2}$\n\n$p^2 = 2q^2$\n\nTherefore, $p^2$ is even, as all even numbers can be written in the form $2k$, where $k$ is some number. In this case, this number is $q^2$.\n\nGiven that $p^2$ is even, then p must also be even, as an even number squared is always even, however an odd number squared is not even.\n\nHere's a slightly better proof for this relationship between numbers and their squares (but badly formatted (i dont have sadler spec book))\n\nCase 1: p is even\n\nGiven $p = 2k$, $p^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2$\n\n$\\therefore p^2 = 2(2k^2)$ where in this case, the number multiplied by 2 is $2k^2$.\n\nCase 2: p is odd\n\nGiven $p = 2k-1, p^2 = (2k-1)^2 = 4k^2-4k+1$\n\n$4k^2 - 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2-2k) + 1$\n\nNow, given $2(k) + 1 = 2(k + 1) -1$,\n\n$2(2k^2-2k) +1 = 2(2k^2-2k+1) -1$\n\n$\\therefore$ $p^2$ is an odd number, following the rule $p = 2k -1$\n\nin this case, $k = 2k^2 -2k+1$\n\nNow, as $p^2$ is even, and $p$ is even, let $p = 2r$\n\nThus, our equation can be written as:\n\n$4r^2 = 2q^2$.\n\n$q^2 = 2(r^2)$\n\nThus, $q^2$ is even, where $k = r^2$.\n\nAs shown above, the square of a number’s parity (even or odd) is the same as the number’s parity. Therefore, $q$ is even.\n\nHowever, this means that both $p$ and $q$ are even, and this contradicts our initial assumption that there are no common factors between $p$ and $q$ (even numbers have the common factor of 2).\n```\n\n\nTherefore, the statement $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{p}{q}$ is false and thus $\\sqrt{2}$ is not rational.\nNumbers like 0.012342342134 are rational, ($\\frac{6171171067}{500000000000}$) and so are all the integers. Numbers like $\\pi$ and $e$ are not rational. (they cannot be expressed as a fraction)\n\nThus, all numbers that are **not** natural, **not** integers and **not** rational, are **real** (for now).

The increase in surface area makes it more likely for the higher-boiling liquid to lose its energy and fall back down as a liquid.\n\t\t- *E.g.* if you have 2 liquids with boiling points 65 and 75, and you place it in a fractional distillation apparatus that boils at a temperature of 70, the 65-liquid would be in a temperature that exceeds their boiling points, so they would have a lot of energy (higher temperatures causes gasses to move faster), so they are much more likely to be able to reach the top due to their high kinetic energy. The 75-liquid would not be as highly charged, however a small portion of its particles may become gaseous. However, the increase in surface area creates a large chance that these particles will hit into the surface area, and as they don’t have much energy they will fall back down as a liquid.\n- *Functional group*: A group of ==covalently bonded== atoms that can replace a hydrogen atom in an organic compound. These groups tend to influence the overall chemical properties of the molecule they are bonded to.\n\t- It also defines the structure of families of compounds\n- *Homologous series*: A group of compounds with a common functional group, branched or unbranched.\n\t- They may also differ by a molecular formula of $CH_2$ (e.g. $CH_4$ and $C_2H_6$ differ by $CH_2$, thus they are of the same **homologous series**)\n\t- *Structural formula*: a formula that displays the arrangement of atoms in a compound.\n\n### Key Ideas\n- *Background Information*: Covalent bonding is the electrostatic force of attraction between a shared pair of electrons *(known as a bonding pair) and the nuclei.  Atoms can share multiple pairs of electrons, up to 3 (4 does not apply, and is generally energetically unfavourable)*.\n\t- When carbon bonds with another atom, the bond is either a:\n\t\t- **Single bond**: One shared pair (indicated by a single line)\n\t\t- **Double bond**: Two shared pairs (indicated by a double line)\n\t\t- **Triple bond**: Three shared pairs (indicated by a triple line)\n- **Fractional Distillation**:\n\t- Uses marginal differences in boiling points between 2 or more miscible liquids\n\t- Uses:\n\t\t- Purification of water\n\t\t- Separation of water from ethanol\n\t\t- Crude oil refining\n\n- Hydrocarbons refer to organic compounds that contain both carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n- Carbon atoms have a **valency of +4 (and -4)**. To obtain a stable electron configuration, carbon tends to bond covalently, and does not form ionic compounds as a result of its valency of +4. \n\t- Carbon atoms covalently bond in the following ways:\n\t\t- Forming 4 single bonds\n- Organic chemistry heavily relies on the **IUPAC naming system**. The IUPAC naming system aims to give us crucial information on the structure and properties of an organic compound.\n\t- For example, **methane**:\n\t\t- **meth**: indicates that the **largest chain** (this is important later on) of carbons only contains 1 carbon atom.\n\t\t- **ane**: indicates that the **largest bond** within the compound is a single bond.\n\t\t- For reference, this is the **structural formula** for methane:\n\t\t- ![[methane.png]]\n\t\t- Notice that there is 1 carbon in the \"largest chain\", as indicated by \"**meth**\", and that there are only single bonds, indicated by **ane**.\n\t- For reference, here are the **prefixes** that indicate the number of carbons in the **largest chain** of an organic compound:\n| Number of carbons | Prefix |\n| ----------------- | ------ |\n| 1                 | meth   |\n| 2                 | eth    |\n| 3                 | prop   |\n| 4                 | but    |\n| 5                 | pent   |\n| 6                 | hex    |\n| 7                 | hept   |\n| 8                 | oct    |\n| 9                 | non    |\n| 10                | dec       |\n- Here's another example, **ethane**:\n\t- **eth**: indicates that the **largest chain** contains **2** carbons\n\t- **ane**: indicates that the largest bond within the compound is a single bond\n\t- At this point, based on the structural formula for methane, try sketching the diagram for ethane.\n\t- Did you get this?\n\t- ![[index 1.png]]\n```ad-question\nTry drawing the rest of these hydrocarbons (e.g. propane, butane, etc.)\n```\n- Here are the **suffixes** and **homologous series** name for the largest bond in an organic compound:\n| Type of bond | Suffix | Homologous series |\n| ------------ | ------ | ---------------- |\n| Single bond  | ane    | Alkanes          |\n| Double bond  | ene    | Alkenes          |\n| Triple bond  | yne    | Alkynes          | \n- Double and triple bonds are special due to the presence of **isomers**, which will be covered later.\n- Structural formula rules (for **alkenes** (**do NOT** use this guideline for **alkenes/alkynes**)) are as follows:\n\t- Draw the **longest chain**\n\n\n\n\n## Questions\n\n\n## Worked Answers\n\n\n## Summary\n\n\n## Class Notes (Yr 10)\n\nCarbon has a valency in 4 (4 number of electrons in valence shell, thus it needs an additional 4 to get a full shell of 8)\n\nHydrocarbons are in a group called alkanes.\n\nif there is a bond that is greater than 2, it is

stabilise the nucleus, and help create the strong nuclear force.\n\nStrong nuclear force:\n- Holds together the subatomic particles of the nucleus (protons and neutrons)\n\nHalf life:\n- Time required

by-product particles.\n- Nuclear fusion: A reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei are combined to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles\n\n**Research:** Advantages/Disadvantages of nuclear energy.\n\n### Internet Investigation\n- What is a radioisotope?\n\t- A **radioactive isotope**.\n\t\t- Radioactive: The emission of energy as *electromagnetic waves or as moving subatomic particles*, especially high-energy particles which cause **ionisation**.\n\t\t- Isotopes: atoms with the *same atomic charge(number of protons)*, but **different atomic mass(number of neutrons)**.\n\t\t- They are **unstable**, and are *able to decay*.\n\t\t\t- *Unstable*: When the strong nuclear force (SNF) and the repulsive force between protons are unbalanced, specific when SNF is weaker\n\t\t\t- \"When the strong nuclear force is less than the electrostatic force of repulsion between protons and neutrons, there is not energy to hold the isotope together, resulting in an emission of energy which breaks down the nucleus.\"\n- What happens when a radioisotope decays?\n\t- Radioisotopes are unstable, and achieve stability, by shedding excess particles and energy through *radioactive decay*.\n\t- The time period for radioactive decay is unique to every isotope, and measured through its **half-life**, which is the time taken for half of the radioisotopes to undergo radioactive decay.\n\t- When radioactive decay occurs in a radioisotope, particles are emitted via alpha, beta and gamma decay, alongside electron capture. \n\t- Other than gamma decay and the conversion of an electron to a less excited state, radiation decay produces daughter atoms with a different number of protons or neutrons.\n\t- **Isotope tries to get to a more stable form, through one or more stages of radiation decay. *This always produces gamma radiation*.**\n\t- e.g. Carbon-14 beta decays to Nitrogen-14.\n- What is produced when a radioisotope decays?\n\t- It depends on the type of decay that occurs. For example, in Alpha decay, a helium-4 atom is released.\n- What are the characteristics of the three main types of radiation\n\t- Alpha radiation: Produces a helium-4 particle with a relative mass of 4, a charge of +2\n\n\n#### Fred stuff\nList significant radioactive sources and isotopes used in agriculture.\n\n-Heat up water without producing CO2\n\n-PCR tests to rapidly detect diseases in livestock\n\n-The addition of Nitrogen-15,\n\nA stable isotope that is used to determine the fertiliser use efficiency of crops.

Weight is the effect of gravity on an object's mass. Therefore, if mass remains constant, then only gravity will affect mass. In comparison to Earth, the moon has less mass than the Earth. Thus, your weight on the moon is a lot less in comparison to when on the Earth as there is less gravitational effect on your gravity.\nQ2. Due to inertia, objects will remain in motion unless an outer force acts upon them. Thus, when the bus stops the passengers inside are still going in a forwards motion. This causes them to move forwards until the force is balanced.\nQ3. According to Newton's 1st Law of Motion, stationary objects remain stationary unless an external unbalanced force acts upon them. In this scenario, although the car is accelerating, I am still a stationary object, until the car's motion acts upon me. This causes me to appear to move backwards, however I am gaining momentum as my motion balances with the cars motion, from a point of stationary movement to an equal motion inline with the car.\nQ4. 1.

This is Ayelet (ph) from Montclair, N.J. I will be turning 40 this year, and in the lead-up to my birthday, I'm trying to accomplish 40 new things. One of those is sending a timestamp to the NPR POLITICS PODCAST. This podcast was recorded at...\n\nTAMARA KEITH, HOST:\n\n2:08 p.m. on Monday, March 28.\n\nAYELET: Things may have changed by the time you hear this, but hopefully I will be one step closer to accomplishing my birthday goal. Enjoy the show.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF THE BIGTOP ORCHESTRA'S \"TEETER BOARD: FOLIES BERGERE (MARCH AND TWO-STEP)\")\n\nKEITH: We got you. Now just 39 more things to do.\n\nDEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: That's ambitious.\n\nKEITH: I hope some of them are easier. Hey there. It's the NPR POLITICS PODCAST. I'm Tamara Keith. I cover the White House.\n\nWALSH: I'm Deirdre Walsh. I cover Congress.\n\nKEITH: And we are checking in on the state of the COVID pandemic in the U.S. today, so we have Allison Aubrey here from NPR's health team. Hey, Allison.\n\nALLISON AUBREY, BYLINE: Hey, Tamara. Hey, Deirdre. Good to be here.\n\nKEITH: So we've got a little bit of politics, a little bit of science, and we are glad to have you joining us for it. Let's start with just the state of things. COVID cases, hospitalizations and, finally, deaths are down in the United States right now. But Dr. Anthony Fauci said last week that it is too early to declare victory over the virus.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nANTHONY FAUCI: This virus has fooled us before, and we really must be prepared for the possibility that we might get another variant. And we don't want to be caught flat-footed on that.\n\nKEITH: So, Allison, what's he talking about there?\n\nAUBREY: I think he's looking across the Atlantic. He sees a surge in the U.K. and in other European countries. And throughout the pandemic, the U.S. has typically tended to trail the U.K. by two or three weeks. You know, cases are so low right now compared to winter, but there has been a plateauing in the decline, so a slowing in the rate of decline. And this is happening at the very time that the very contagious omicron subvariant BA.2 has gained some traction. So there is some concern, but big picture, people in the U.S. are much better protected given the combo of vaccines, immunity from natural infection and medicines to treat than anybody was a year and a half ago.\n\nWALSH: So, Allison, the federal government and the states have really done away with the COVID precautions that were in place for the omicron surge, things like mask mandates, vaccine requirements. So given that and what you just said about, you know, cases overseas, how prepared is the United States for another surge?\n\nAUBREY: I think it depends on what happens in the next several months. Will Congress and the White House work out how to pay for vaccines and medicines going forward for COVID? Another factor is how good is the U.S. surveillance system going to be to spot potential new, troublesome variants if they're - if they come around? You know, there's been a big effort to improve wastewater surveillance, to serve as a kind of early warning system for an outbreak. And this is a kind of passive surveillance that becomes really important come fall, when, say, people are no longer doing routine COVID testing. Everyone will still be going to the bathroom every day, and wastewater is a very good way to track how much virus is circulating. So the administration says the wastewater surveillance system needs to be funded.\n\nKEITH: Deirdre, when we talk about the federal funding, that does remain a great big question mark. The White House has been asking for more money. Congress passed this big budget bill that was like a freight train that you couldn't slow down, but the COVID money was thrown off - overboard.\n\nWALSH: It was. I mean, there was a bipartisan deal with the House and the Senate and the White House to include a little bit more than $15 billion in that broader spending bill that also had money for Ukraine and earmarks for members of Congress. But at the last minute, a group of House Democrats cried foul because part of the deal Democrats made with Republicans is that they were going to pay for the new spending, and they were, you know, offsetting it or they were paying for this new spending bill, clawing back some of the unspent COVID money that was going to the states. And a bunch of members from those states who hadn't, you know, spent the money but had plans for it, had budgeted things that they were already planning to do with the money, said they wouldn't vote for the bill. And they literally didn't have the votes to pass it. So now there are negotiations going on mostly on the Senate side to try to come up with a bipartisan deal that can get 60 votes in the Senate. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has been working with Utah Republican Mitt Romney, so we're looking at probably something a little less than that was in that broader deal. And we'll see possibly maybe this week if they can get a deal together.\n\nKEITH: Yeah. And we should say that there's been something of a back and forth over the last couple of weeks with members of Congress, especially Romney's been very vocal, saying we need to know more about how this money has been spent, all of the money, and the White House saying we've given it to you. And then last week, there was a briefing where the head of the COVID response, Jeff Zients, at the White House, like, literally held up a binder, right, Allison?\n\nAUBREY: That's right. He said, look, I've got 385 pages of documents and tables, and we have accounted for all of the money that has been appropriated for COVID. He basically says we're kind of headed into a funding emergency if Congress doesn't act.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJEFF ZIENTS: Time is of the essence, as we heard across the briefing today. With every day that passes, we risk not having the tools we need to fight COVID.\n\nWALSH: I think the other thing that happened since this bipartisan deal sort of fell apart is there's been some reporting on some, you know, what you would call misuse of COVID funds. The Associated Press did a story about sort of some of the money going to, you know, programs that really don't have a lot - a direct link to COVID. So Republicans who were already raising questions are pointing to that report and saying that the tables that the administration showed them in terms of where all the money has gone so far, included some of the big federal agencies like HHS but didn't include some of the other agencies that also had COVID spending programs. So I think they're just sort of, you know, continuing to throw more asks onto the list for the administration before they're ready to support another bill.\n\nKEITH: Allison, I want to circle around to an important question, which is what happens if this money doesn't come through or what is being lost? What is the effect of the White House not getting the money that they're asking for? Is is there a real-world effect?\n\nAUBREY: Right now, I think the effect is a bit theoretical because it's unclear how much money will come through when. So I visited a federally qualified health clinic last week in Alexandria, Va. I interviewed the medical director. He said, yes, we're quite concerned. Any time you talk about curbing funding, look, we've been able to vaccinate people because of direct government funding of the vaccination program. We have medicines here that we can deliver to our patients because of the direct funding from the federal government. I don't know how I would buy these medicines if we weren't getting direct funding. But at the same time, he acknowledged that they have multiple streams of funding coming in, and it's not clear which ones might be at risk of being cut off. The secretary of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra, also weighed in on this last week at the White House. He basically said, look, we'll have to just keep moving money around to keep COVID prevention and treatments going if Congress doesn't act.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nXAVIER BECERRA: We'll exhaust every dollar that we have. We'll use every dollar that we can - that is flexibly available to continue to provide for the need.\n\nAUBREY: Ultimately, he said, they'd have to look for other ways to pay if Congress doesn't authorize more funding; he said maybe moving towards allowing Americans to purchase, you know, vaccines or treatments through other means.\n\nKEITH: All right. We're going to take a quick break. And when we get back, another round of COVID boosters?\n\nAnd we're back. And the FDA is expected to approve another booster dose, another vaccine dose for people aged 50 and over this week. Allison, what's the thinking behind that?\n\nAUBREY: Well, the reasoning is that immunity does diminish some over time. I mean, the protection against serious illness and death holds up, but particularly in older people and those who are immune compromised, prior studies have shown that boosters help shore up protection. Now, there's not a lot of data yet on how much protection or how long protection would hold up from a fourth dose. Another question is what kind of booster may be best - one that combines protection against multiple variants, an omicron-specific booster or something different. So what we can look for this week might be the beginning of the process. It might be an authorization that it's OK to give a fourth dose. But I do think that there are a lot of questions that still need to be answered.\n\nKEITH: All right. Well, because this is the POLITICS PODCAST, I do want to get back to the politics, too, which is that COVID was obviously dominant in the 2020 election. We are now headed into these 2022 midterms. Deirdre, are people running for office even talking about COVID? Is this on the radar?\n\nWALSH: It is, but it's in a different way than it was in 2020. I think a lot of lawmakers, and they say a lot of their constituents, are moving on from the pandemic. I mean, at least on Capitol Hill, you know, they lifted the mask mandate. The tours - the public tours are starting back up this week. But there are a lot of issues from the pandemic that are still hanging over the 2022 midterms - issues like the impact that the pandemic had on education, issues about parents' rights, parents' concerns about the pandemic on their kids. I think there is still a lot of, you know, political debate about how lawmakers and states and governors handled the pandemic and how they potentially didn't respond to the concerns that parents raised. That's a big issue that I expect to hear a lot about. And I also think inflation because of, you know, supply chain issues related to the pandemic is probably the driving factor in the midterms. So it may not be sort of phrased the same way that it was in the 2020 election, but it - the pandemic is leading to driving debate about the sort of key issues that a lot of lawmakers are going to be talking about and running ads on right up until November.\n\nKEITH: Right - because the pandemic was this huge disruptive thing that is continuing, to this day, to be hugely disruptive in various ways in the fabric of society and also in the - you know, literally in the supply chains.\n\nWALSH: Right. And I think a lot of Democrats on Capitol Hill are really looking to the White House to try to - I mean, they know this is going to be a referendum on the Biden presidency. So, Tam, like, what are they saying about what the messaging from there is going to be going into the midterms?\n\nKEITH: Well, they are definitely not in a mission accomplished, spike the football mode, but they are certainly trying to move the pandemic to a place where it is - you know, it's the background music. It is not the dominant thing that they are talking about or working about - not the dominant thing that the White House is talking about as it was earlier in the administration, even as, right now, the press secretary and deputy press secretary both have COVID. So, you know, it continues to be a thing that rears its head in ways that it will because it is a contagious virus. But the White House is moving to this place where they are saying, look, all of the tools are available, especially if Congress comes through with the funding. But, you know, there's medications. There's testing. There's at-home testing - all of these tools available. The White House is going to put them all in one place so that they are easy to access and easy to find. And the message from the CDC is, you know, look it up. See what the level of COVID spread is in your region, and make your decisions based on that, whether to wear a mask or not. The idea is that they have, in theory - and, Allison, I'd be curious what you think of this - but that they've sort of set up a structure that can dial up and dial down based on the threat level.\n\nAUBREY: Yeah. I think that was really clear the last time they, you know, finally said, OK, we are no longer recommending sort of universal masking. You can - kids can take, you know, masks off at schools. It was very clear then kind of, like - there's an old expression that all public health is local. And now the CDC is saying, all right. We're giving you a way to - we're giving you all the information you need. Now you need to figure out how to act on the information. If cases go up, here's your tools to add protection back in. If cases go down, dial them back down.\n\nKEITH: All right. Well, we are going to leave it there for now. Allison Aubrey, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nAUBREY: It was great to be here.

The issue with current nuclear reactors is that they allow the build-up of heavy radioactive waste, which has incredibly long half-lives and will produce toxic radiation for millennia. This issue is currently being combatted by disposing the waste deep underground to prevent environmental leaks, and through mitigating the radioactivity of waste. However, there have been some promising proposals to this issue, such as using fast breeder reactors that can break down heavy radioactive waste into harmful and short-lived waste. Proposals like this are still mostly theoretical, and studies into them do not indicate whether they are still feasible.\n\n## What is nuclear waste?\n\nRadioactive waste is measured based on the substance's half-life and its radioactivity:\n(**according to the International Atomic Energy Agency**)\n- HLW High level waste\n- ILW Intermediate level waste\n- LLW Low level waste\n\nThe majority of all nuclear waste is considered LLW or lower, and takes up approximately 90% of the total volume of nuclear waste, while producing mere fractions of the total radiation released by nuclear waste.\n\nStandard nuclear fuel cycles end up producing transuranic waste products, i,e. isotopes with a greater charge than Uranium, and minor actinides, elements created via chains of neutron capture.\n\nIn chains of neutron capture, neutrons are absorbed by large radioisotopes such as Uranium-238, allowing numerous instances of $\\beta -$ decay and the production of heavy actinides. These isotopes take much longer to decay into harmless materials when compared to other radioisotopes, for example while Radium-228 has a half-life of 5.75 years before $\\beta -$ decay, Plutonium-244 has a half life of 80 million years before it undergoes $\\alpha$ decay.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220905094700.png]]\n\nWhile HLW account for less than 0.1% of the total volume of nuclear waste, it is the most dangerous in terms of radioactivity, and due to this it has posed incredibly hard to effectively store, considering the quantity of HLW increases by 12000 tonnes every year. Estimates show that it accounts for 95% of all the radiation produces by nuclear waste.\n\n## Dangers of Nuclear waste\nNuclear waste, specifically ILW and HLW, pose significant threats to the environment, if improperly stored. The high levels of radiation released by leaks of nuclear waste can cause cancerous growth in animal and plant life, and cause significant genetic changes that may affect generations of life. \n\nHuman exposure to HLW and ILW results in severe radiation health effects, such as:\n- Vomiting and nausea\n- Increased risk of cancer\n- Increased risk of cardiovascular disease\n- Skin burns\n- Death\n\n## Compared to coal and gas combustion\nCompared to coal and gas combustion, nuclear energy produces radioactive toxic waste, whereas coal and gas produces greenhouse gasses (GHGs) which unhelpfully amplify the Greenhouse effect.\n\nStudies conducted by the Nuclear Energy Initiative show that the United States alone has avoided producing almost 17,000 million tonnes of Carbon dioxide emissions. This is by discontinuing coal and gas power plants in favour of nuclear power plants, which produce significantly less carbon dioxide or GHG emissions.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220906085024.png]]\n\nFurthermore, there is an estimated 250 million tonnes of nuclear waste in storage. In comparison, over a billion tonnes of coal alone is burned for energy, producing approximately 2.86 billion tonnes of purely carbon dioxide emissions. Although nuclear waste is highly toxic to organic life and is a financial burden to store safely, compared to the harmful by-products of coal and gas combustion it has less of a negative impact on the environment. Coal combustion alone contributes the most carbon dioxide emissions when compared to all other sources of energy, and has significantly amplified the effects of the Greenhouse effect.\n\nThus, compared to coal and gas combustion, nuclear waste is much more ecofriendly in terms of its contribution to the Greenhouse effect. \n\n## How waste is currently disposed\nScientists in recently years have tried to mitigate the toxic properties of nuclear waste by treating waste to be more easily stored. This is initially done through vitrification, the process by which nuclear waste is stabilized so that it does not spontaneously react or decay for long periods of time. Numerous other methods of remediation have been considered, such as bio-mediation, as specific biological organisms have shown to be adept at decomposing certain radioactive wastes such as Strontium-90.\n\nIt should be noted that not all nuclear waste has no applications in the real world, and some waste isotopes such as caesium-137 have been used for food irradiation.\n\nCurrently, geological means of storing the waste has been favoured, as it keeps the waste far away from contaminating ecosystems. In general, large, stable geological sites are dug out via either mining equipment or tunnel bores, where waste will be kept. The core idea is that nuclear waste is kept far away from any human activity. Generally, extra security is kept around nuclear waste, such as concrete walls.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220906092633.png]]\n\nThis method has not proven to be fully effective, as there have been numerous instances where nuclear waste has leaked from its containment, into local environments. \n\n## Future Methods for Nuclear waste Disposal\nThere have been recent developments in using transmutation, i.e. creating nuclear reactors to transmute nuclear waste into shorter-lived and potentially less dangerous nuclear waste. However, these forms of experimental nuclear reactors most likely will consume more energy than they produce, which makes them financially unsustainable.\n\nThe idea of fast neutron reactors have been thrown around as a viable new type of reactor that solves the issue of nuclear waste. Presently, thermal nuclear reactors are used, where neutrons move at almost exactly the same speed as the nuclear fuel inside the reactor. However, fast neutron reactors are when there is no moderation or slowing-down of neutrons, and instead move at significantly faster velocities.\n\nIn thermal reactors, neutrons move at about 2200m/s, while in fast neutron reactors, neutrons move at more than 9 million m/s.\n\nThe significantly increased speed of neutrons significantly reduces the capture to fission ratio. When a neutron collides with an atom, it can either be absorbed by the atom's nucleus, or cause nuclear fission, which is the fundamental principle of nuclear energy. According to de Broglie's Wavelength Hypothesis, all matter exhibits wave-like properties, including neutrons. Faster neutrons have a larger amplitude and a shorter wavelength, as they have a greater kinetic energy. Thus, when faster neutrons collide with the atoms of nuclear fuel, they spend less time inside the nucleus, and thus are less likely to be absorbed, Furthermore, the intense energy of the neutron increases the chances for fission to occur, as the impact force favours nuclear fission.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220906102940.png]]\n\nWith models of fast reactors, breeder reactors become even more viable, which stipulates that a high neutron economy can be managed via fission reactions that produce more neutrons than required to initiate them. In this way, fuel is 'bred', by using these neutrons to convert fertile fuel into fissile fuel. Fertile refers to material that is itself not fissile, but can be converted into fissile material via neutron absorption. For example, when fertile Thorium-232 absorbs a neutron, it undergoes 2 reactions of $\\beta -$ decay to produce fissile Uranium-233.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220906143802.png]]\n\n![[Pasted image 20220906102131.png]]\n\nIn thermal breeder reactors, this process produces unsustainable, heavy transuranic elements, which compose the majority of HLW and are a major downside to thermal breeder reactors. However, due to the immense speed of neutrons in fast breeder reactors, even the largest and longest-lived nuclear waste can undergo nuclear fission. In doing so, fast breeders can convert HLW into harmless waste that would decay much faster.\n\n![[index.jpg]]\n\nThere are some downsides to fast breeder reactors, however. Currently, the process is entirely experimental, and current data shows that the concept of a breeder reactor may not be feasibly possible in the first place. Experiments have only achieved a neutron to fission ratio of 1.1, which while would sustain a fast breeder reactor, does not allow random loss of neutrons. Furthermore, currently models for fast breeder reactors incur some consequence in their upkeep, for example Thorium-based fast breeder reactors build up Uranium-232 waste, which generally will produce a wide array of radioactive waste. Furthermore, Protactinium-231 is an intermediary atom in the production of fissile Uranium-233, but eventually as concentrations of Thorium-230 decrease, the amount of Protactinium-231 becomes equal with the amount of Protactinium-231 that undergoes neutron absorption, resulting in a significant loss of efficiency and energy produced.\n\nFurthermore, investment into this new concept of nuclear energy is expensive, as fast breeder reactors demand extreme environments and exotic coolants. The need for exotic coolants stems from the idea of elastic collisions, as neutrons that collide with heavy compounds lose minimal amount of energy compared to neutrons that collide with smaller compounds, such as water. Exotic coolants must be cared for and tend to react with materials of the fast breeder reactor, and thus even more money must be expended to sustain the use of these coolants.\n\nThe possibility of liquid metal, or molten salt as mobile phases for transporting nuclear fuel is a promising concept. For example, the BN-600 reactor in Russia uses melted Sodium as its mobile phase. However, Sodium reacts vigorously with standard environments, and there have been numerous instances of fires in the reactor as a result of the Sodium coolant. Furthermore, it appears that the technology and engineering behind fast breeder reactors is simply not advanced enough to accommodate for both the extreme environments and the use of experimental coolants and mobile phases. Molten salt is also viable, however due to the nature of ions, some cations may oxidize and produce insoluble salts that could cause unpredictable damage to the internals of fast breeder reactors. For example, salt containing Chlorine have chloride ions that may absorb neutrons such as when Chlorine-35 becomes Chlorine-36, which beta decays into Sulfur-36. There has been promising study into the use of $FLiBe$ mixtures, i.e molten salt of Fluorine, Lithium and Beryllium. \n\n![[Pasted image 20220906103359.png]]\n\n## Bibliography: APA 7\n- _Thorium fuel cycle — potential benefits and challenges - IAEA_.

Mixtures do not have well-defined, set properties such as melting points, so understanding the nature of matter would be difficult using mixtures.\n\n**Main properties - pure substances in a mixture:**\n\n-   Solubility\n-   Density\n-   Boiling point\n-   Particle size\n\n**Separation Techniques:**\n\n-   Sieving: Separates components of a mixture based on particle size.\n-   Filtration and evaporation: Separates components based on solubility and volatility.\n    -   Filtration is a form of sieving.\n-   Gravity separation: Separates based on densities\n    -   Decanting: Separates solid-liquid mixtures based on densities.\n-   Distillation: Separates based on boiling point differences.\n-   Fractional distillation: Separates components with really close boiling points.\n\n\nmy bad notes\n\n**Separation techniques:**\n\nDiagram Notes: 2d and with ruler - Note: (D) means you **need to be able to draw a diagram of this separation technique.**\n\n**Sieving:**\n\n-   A porous (containing pores) material is utilized to separate particles of different sizes.\n-   Physical Property: Particle size\n    -   Note: sieves can be stacked upon each other, with the largest pores at the top, to separate mixtures with more than 2 different particle sizes.\n\n![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9b85eb5d-5ff5-429c-b954-0787402e3a2c/Untitled.png)\n\n**Filtration: (D)**\n\n-   A porous material separates a solid from a liquid in a mixture.\n    -   Physical property: Particle size\n    -   **The solid should not be soluble in the liquid.**\n\n![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/bdd75a46-62af-4edd-9fd3-1337d293ea39/Untitled.png)\n\n**Decanting:**\n\n-   Separates **particulates (solids in water?)** from a liquid, by letting the solids settle at the bottom of the mixture while pouring off the particle free liquids.\n    \n    -   Physical property: Density\n-   This also works with **immiscible liquids,** with the lighter one being poured off.\n    \n    -   This is where the **separating funnel comes in (D):**\n        -   Separates multiple liquids by partitioning the constituents based on their density.\n    \n    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/eb9a2cbd-4995-4ff3-b290-f2c0bbc1bea5/Untitled.png)\n    \n\n**Distillation (D):**\n\n-   Separates homogenous mixtures (solutions), based on the boiling points of its constituents. In general, aqueous constituents are converted into a gaseous state, and reconverted back into a liquid (as **distillate**).\n    -   Remember to label the blocky thing **condenser!!**\n-   Can be used to separate more than 2 liquids, if they have different boiling points\n-   This is called a **distillation apparatus**\n\n![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/cb4d881c-7117-4ee6-818b-9eaabb551485/Untitled.png)\n\n-   Fractional distillation (D) - not overly complex diagram e.g. for crude oil\n    \n    -   Used when separating mixtures with similar boiling points\n        \n    -   In general, the path that the boiled products take to reach the condenser is extended, or surface area is increased, usually through the use of glass beads\n        \n        -   In theory (Kinetic theory of gas particles), the lower-boiling liquid will have a lot of kinetic energy, whereas the higher-boiling liquid will have less as it approaches its boiling point but does not completely reach or exceed it. The increase in surface area makes it more likely for the higher-boiling liquid to lose its energy and fall back down as a liquid.\n    -   This increases the purity of the condensed product.\n        \n        \u003e E.g. if you have 2 liquids with boiling points 65 and 75, and you place it in a fractional distillation apparatus that boils at a temperature of 70, the 65-liquid would be in a temperature that exceeds their boiling points, so they would have a lot of energy (higher temperatures causes gasses to move faster), so they are much more likely to be able to reach the top due to their high kinetic energy. The 75-liquid would not be as highly charged, however a small portion of its particles may become gaseous. However, the increase in surface area creates a large chance that these particles will hit into the surface area, and as they don’t have much energy they will fall back down as a liquid.\n        \n    \n    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4ce1fdb4-b12e-4ddc-be80-b85a55c22396/Untitled.png)\n    \n\n**Crystallisation:**\n\n-   Creates a **pure** solid structure composed of a formerly dissolved constituent. - **only works for homogenous mixtures (solutions)**\n    \n    -   When the solvent evaporates, the dissolved constituent collects as crystals.\n    -   Essentially, the solubility of a solution is rapidly increased and decreased(using heat generally)\n    \n    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/65e6b3b4-56df-4ab1-acbd-1fb46d7a7377/Untitled.png)\n    \n\n**Vaporisation:**\n\n-   Extracting dissolved solute from a solution. Essentially, use this over distillation if you don’t care about the liquid.\n-   Heat is used to evaporate the liquid, leaving only the dissolved solute.\n    -   NOTE: DO NOT use vaporisation if your substance is extremely volatile or decomposes at high temperature, such as Ammonium Nitrate.\n\n![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3fb964d2-d380-4d5c-bf44-3c7cc92c2a28/Untitled.png)\n\nSeparating Mixtures:\n\n-   Mixtures can be separated by any means that makes use of the different physical properties of its constituents.\n-   The properties of the components of a mixture determine the best separation method\n\n(NOTE TO SELF: research titration)\n\n\n\n---\n## Recall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Summary","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/Solubility":{"title":"","content":"Status: \n\nTags: ","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/Spec-Notes":{"title":"","content":"\n*Date: 2022 04 23 Time: 18:24*\n\nStatus: #11SPEC \n\nTags: \n\n# Spec Notes\n\n[[notes/Brilliant Course Complex Numbers]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/Stoichiometry":{"title":"","content":"Status: \n\nTags: \n","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/Sunday":{"title":"","content":"**Sunday Routine:**\n\n-   6am - Wake up, do the following for 1 hour:\n    -   Brush teeth\n    -   Shower\n    -   **Eat breakfast - prioritise this**\n-   7am - Study for 2 hours using tomato method\n-   9am - Take a 1 hour break\n-   10am - Study till lunch\n-   12pm - Eat lunch\n-   1pm - Study for 2 hours\n-   3pm - Take a 30 min break\n-   3.30pm - Relax (e.g. gamin/minceraft time) for one and a half hours\n-   5pm - Eat dinner for an hour\n-   6pm - Study for two hours\n-   8pm - Take a break and wind down\n\nTags: #personalnotes ","lastmodified":"2022-09-12T13:04:27.547775431Z","tags":null},"/The-Periodic-Table":{"title":"","content":"Status: \n\nTags: \n\nPeriod number is equal the the electron shell that an element's valency electrons occupy. E.g. in period 2, the valence electrons are on the n = 2 shells.\n\nGroups have the same valence electron number, and this will dictate their chemical properties / the ways they bond.\n\nNote: They are **similar** but not the same. Some are more/less reactive than others.\n\nMost elements will try to reach stability of **nearest noble gas**. \n\nE.g. Potassium has an electronic configuration of $2,8,8,1$, it will achieve stability by losing electrons to have the electron configuration of its nearest noble gas (Argon). \n\nAs you go lower on a group, elements get more reactive.\n\nThis is because attraction to nucleus is lower as the number of shells increase (and the distance from the energy levels and nucleus increases).\n\nTo become an ion you require ionisation energy.\n\nIonisation energy is needed to break the attraction between an electron and its nucleus, so the further away an electron is from its nucleus the weaker the attraction force, and thus less ionisation energy is required to ionise.\n\n\n\n\nThus, elements in higher periods are more reactive.\n\nTherefore, elements in higher periods have lower ionisation energy.\n\n**Non-metals typically gain electrons.**\n\nTypical behaviour of group 7 (non-metals) is to gain electrons.\n\n**Check for diatomic molecules!!**\n\ne.g.\n\n$Cl_{2}+ 2\\bar e \\rightarrow 2Cl^-$\n\nWhat is charge of nitride\n\nNitrogen has an electron configuration of $2,5$. Therefore, if it wants to reach stability via its nearest noble gas (Neon), which has an electron configuration of $2,5$, it must gain 3 electrons, becoming negative.\n\n$N_{2}+ 6 \\bar e \\rightarrow 2N^{-3}$ - this is the **reduction reaction** for nitrogen. redox be like\n\nThe actual electron description formula (?) is:\n\n$N+ 3 \\bar e \\rightarrow N^{-3}$\n\nNote here we are simply describing the redistribution of electrons for one nitrogen atom. Realistically, if this were to happen in nature it would involve 2 atoms, as Nitrogen is diatomic.\n\nBecause nitrogen has a smaller atom, and when nitrogen gains electrons, the nucleus's attraction to the electron will be stronger than, for example, phosphorus, as the nucleus' attractive force will be stronger as distance decreases.\n\n**Principle quantum number** is the term for n.\n\n**A new energy level of shell is started at the beginning of each new Period.**\n\n**Period number is the principle quantum number of the shell being filled.**\n\n**Group number is the number of electrons in the outer shell.** (somewhat, not including the transition metals)\n\nTo determine whether something is polar or non-polar, you have to take into account the following:\n* relative **electronegativity** of composite atoms\n* shape of molecule\n\nLooking at **symmetry** of charges, not the symmetry of molecules.\n\nDipole is cancelled. \n\nDipole refers to the slightly negative/positive areas of a molecule\n\n**Periodic Trends**:\n* Electronegativity **increases** across a period because:\n1. The atomic radius **decreases**. \n2. The charge of the nucleus **increases** without significant extra shielding. New electrons do not contribute much to shielding because they are added to the same principal energy level across the period.\n\n* Electronegativity **decreases** down a period because:\n1. The atomic radius **increases**.\n2. Although the charge on the nucleus increases, shielding also **increases** significantly. This is because electrons added down the group fill new principle electron levels.\n\n**Ionisation Energy**:\n* Upon applying energy, solids will turn into liquids, which will turn into gas.\n* This is called vaporisation.\n* If energy is continuously applied, a gas becomes an ion.\n* However, there are two processes for the two types of ion.\n* For the cation process, energy is absorbed.\n* For the anion process, energy is released.\n* Ionisation energy is:\n\t* **Energy required to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of gaseous atoms.**\n\ne.g. $X_{g} \\rightarrow X^+_{g}+\\bar e^-$\n\n**The first ionisation energy of an element is the energy required to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of gaseous atoms.**\n\nThe first ionisation energy is therefore a measure of the strength of the attraction between the outermost electron and the nucleus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n\n**Effective nuclear charge** = **Nuclear charge** - **shielding**.\n\nGoing across a period, nuclear charge increases.\n\nWhen atomic radius decreases, electrons become closer and closer to the nucleus. Thus, it would be difficult to remove electrons from an atom. \n\n**There is a general increase in the first ionisation energies across periods.**\n\nAcross period 3, the proton number increases but the amount of shielding does not change significantly. \nThe effective nuclear charge **increases**.\n\nThe greater attraction between the nucleus and the outermost electrons mean\n\nOuter electrons are closer to the nucleus, thus they will experience **stronger nuclear attraction**, and thus will require more energy to remove from an atom.\n\n**Always mention more/less energy required!!!!**\n\nAs you move along the period, e.g. from Sodium to Argon,\n\n* Nuclear charge increases.\n* **Atomic radius decreases?!!!**\n* The principal quantum number (energy shell) stays the same for elements in a period.\n\n\nIncreasing the number of electrons in the inner shells will shield outermost electrons from occupying the outermost principal quantum number .\n\n**As nuclear charge increases, electrons in n=1 become closer. This applies for all other shells.**\n\ne.g. Na has an atomic charge of 11. In comparison, Argon has a charge of 18. Because of this, it will attract the electrons in n=1 better (electrostatic attraction increases)\n\nElectronegativity: Is the ability for an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons in a covalent bond.\n\nCovalent bond: shared pair of electrons in a chemical bond\n\nValence electrons of non-metals that are not shared in the chemical bond are called **lone pairs**. /non bonding\n\nHCl is a polar molecule.\n\nHydrogen has no shielding, whereas chlorine has 10 electrons of shielding. Thus, hydrogen's nucleus is more attracted to chlorine's electrons than chlorine is to its. Therefore, chlorine pulls hydrogen towards its nucleus closer than hydrogen pulls chlorine. \n\nWe would write chlorine as $\\delta -$ , as since it pulls hydrogen closer the electron shared is closer to chlorine, and we write hydrogen as $\\delta +$, as its partially lost its electron.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220315150921.png]]\n\nHere, hydrogen has a weaker positive nuclear attractive force than chlorine (10 of its charge is shielded by it), so it does not attract the **bonding pair** as much as chlorine \n\n\n==Patterns in the Periodic table:\n\n==Across the period, atomic radius will decrease. (increasing electrons will increase attraction between them and nucleus, decreasing radius)\n\n==Going down groups, atomic radius will increase. (shells are being added). \n\n* ==Electrons are added to a new shell as you go down a period.\n* ==Nuclear charge increases,\n* ==Effective nuclear charge\n\n==Larger atoms mean that valence electrons can be lost more easily, as they are further away from the nucleus and thus experience less weak nuclear attraction force. \n\n==**Valency**:\n\n* ==*Valency is the **combining power** of an atom and is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms it could combine with or displace from a compound. (Hydrogen has a valency of 1)*\n* ==**Valency and number of valence electrons are not the same thing**\n* ==e.g. Nitrogen:\n\t* ==Nitrogen has a valency of 3, thus to achieve stability via gaining the electron configuration of nearest noble gas, it must lose 3 electrons. \n\t* ==Here, the number of valence electrons is 5, but the valency is 3.\n* ==**Principle quantum shells - refers to the shells of an atom. e.g. Sodium's principle quantum shells represents 2,8,1.**\n* ==*Nuclear attraction is derived from the nuclear charge of an element minus the number of **inner** electrons shielding the

and biological pollutants**.\n- In general, control of pollutants at their source is more effective than remediation because of their persistence in the environment and concentration through the food chain.\n- Elevated levels of:\n\t- salinity\n\t- nutrients\n\t- metals\n\t- pathogens\n\t- organic contaminants (e.g. pesticides)\n- result in low water quality in Australia\n- **Pollutants** result from agriculture, industry and urban areas (wide range of souces) (most prevalently ag + urb, due to **catchment land use**)\n- Sediment layers at the bottom of waterways are a major sink for nutrients and contaminants, which can be released into waters and become toxic under certain conditions.\n- New contaminants, for example pharmaceuticals, are continually emerging and much monitoring and research is focused on detecting their presence and toxicity in aquatic environments.\n\n---\n- Either water treatment or the protection of sources (e.g. water supply catchments for Perth)\n- Pollutants may enter the food chain \n\t- -\u003e fisheries depend on water quality\n\t- -\u003e agricultural productivity may be affected\n\t- -\u003e some aquatic ecosystems may be damaged due to low water quality\n\n**Main nutrients in water:**\n- phosphorus\n- nitrogen\n- cations\n- trace metals\n- biological constituents (living things)\n\n- Physical properties of water (temp, light penetration(?)) affect survivability of aquatic organisms\n\ne.g. Dams release water into rivers **from the top**, as the lower-most water is too cold/deprived of oxygen.\n\n- Ecosystems adapt to **natural water quality**\n\t- **Changes in water quality** can greatly affect survivability/life\n\n**Pollution:**\n- Can result from changes in the naturally occurring concentration of some components in water\n\t- e.g. nutrient levels too high, algae grows toxically\n\t- Most commonly, oxygen levels go too low\n- Also result from man-made constituents that do not naturally occur in water \n\t- e.g. pharmaceutical products leak into river\n\n**Steps to manage pollution in river basin/groundwater system:\n- Define use/value of water + risk to said use/value due to pollution\n- Sources of pollution should be identified (+pathways in which the pollution may reach the water)\n\t- For large water supply catchments, there may be multiple sources, and pollutants (chem/bio only) can transform as they are transported\n\t\t- e.g. herbicides can degrade to be harmless, thus they only act as pollutants close to the water source\n- Targets for water quality are set, and actions to achieve them\n- Water quality should be monitored so pollution risks can be identified, and to evaluate effectiveness of present pollution management strategies.\n- Water from **point source pollution** (when pollutants are discharged e.g. pipe, factory) has improved recently due to better regulations. \n\t- This is an example of effective pollution management strategies.\n\n**Examples of point source pollution**\n- Industrial plants\n- Hospitals\n- Sewage treatment plants\n- Mine sites\n\n- Widespread pollution of water (**diffuse pollution**) from usage of land where water is collected (**catchment land use**) is hard to combat \n\t- This is currently the biggest water pollution problem today\n- **Examples of catchment land use** are for agricultural and urban land use.\n\n## Point Source Vs Diffuse Pollution:\nPoint source: Pollution that is discharged from a single source (e.g. a discharge pipe). \nDiffuse: The release of pollution from multiple sources that individually may not affect water quality\n\n## Important!! /\\\n\n**Examples of pollution from catchment land use**\n- Salt \n- Nitrogen\n- Phosphorus\n- Suspended sediment (?)\n- Note that some are **natural constituents** of water, therefore the concentration required to prevent ecological damage are variable (+ hard to determine)\n\n### Salinity\n\n- Affects a lot of agriculture.\n- Salinity is ultimately caused from rainfall (ocean spray in rainfall)\n\t- Salt accumulates in soil\n\n**How to reduce**\n- Revegetation of water catchments\n- Using pastures (grazing land for animals) \n\t- both need large areas\n- **Salt interception schemes** pump salt to be evaporated/stored\n- Quality irrigation practices\n- The effect of salinity is more pronounced during wet years.\n\n#### Insert

                                            \n- Use distillation or reverse osmosis\n- hey christian instead of reading this in github why dont you get a zip file and download it so you can properly search for distillation notes because im not gonna write them here for you\n- Osmosis occurs when water moves from a region of **low** salt concentration to **high** salt concentration.\n- If there exists a semipermeable membrane that allows water but not the salt ions, then water will leave from the fresh water to salt water.\n- However when pressure is applied to the salt water, water is pushed through the membrane, leaving just the salt water.\n- ![[Pasted image 20220719191707.png]]\n- The problem with reverse osmosis is finding membranes that are durable and do not break under the high amounts of pressure.\n\n### Algal Blooms\n- Algae provide food for aquatic wildlife\n- Examples include phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, diatoms and seaweed.\n- **Eutrophication**: Water sources become enriched in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus\n\t- This leads to algae overgrowth(**known as algal blooms**), and the production of **blue-green algae**, which is toxic to animals and people that come in contact.\n\t- When **algal blooms** decompose, dissolved oxygen in water is consumed, resulting in the death of fish.\n- **Importantly, light, turbidity(opacity of water) and water stratification (when water separates into distinct levels) are the most important triggers for algal blooms. **\n- In Australia, water stratification occurs readily. This allows for more algal blooms.\n- Turbidity benefits toxic algal blooms, as they float up and out-compete other algae struggling for light.\n- **Managing local conditions provides short-term help**, rather than reducing the run-off of sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus (i.e. reducing eutrophication)\n- **Ways to combat algal blooms**:\n\t- Water can be mechanically stirred, this increases oxygen and reduces stratification\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Acid sulfate soils explained\n\n![](https://www.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0011/64010/pyrite.jpg)\n\nMicroscopic image of pyrite in soil\n\nSouthern Cross University\n\nCommon in many parts of the world, acid sulfate soils are saturated with water, almost oxygen-free and contain microscopic crystals of iron sulfide minerals (commonly [pyrite](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/land/management/soil/soil-testing/soil-terms)).\n\nAcid sulfate soils are safe and harmless when not disturbed. If acid sulfate soils are dug up or drained they come into contact with oxygen. The pyrite in the soil reacts with the oxygen and oxidises.\n\nThis process turns pyrite into sulfuric acid, which can cause damage to the environment and to buildings, roads and other structures.\n\nThe acid also attacks soil minerals, releasing metals like aluminium and iron. Rainfall can then wash the acid and metals from the disturbed soil into the surrounding environment.\n\n\n## Pearson Notes\n### 15.1 Essential water\n- Sources of chemical contamination:\n\t- Run-off from farms and cities\n\t- Run-off from industrial and mining wastes\n\t- Lead used in solder in copper water pipes\n- Types of chemical contaminants:\n\t- Heavy metals\n\t- Pollutants from fertilisers\n\t- Organic pollutants\n\n- Heavy metal contamination\n\t- The main heavy metals are mercury and lead\n\t- Other heavy metals:\n\t\t- Copper\n\t\t- Lead\n\t\t- Cadmium\n\t\t- Nickel\n\t\t- Zinc\n\t\t- Arsenic\n\t\t- Mercury\n\t\t- Common effects: Cancer, organ/nervous system damage, death\n\t- Mining is a main example of heavy metal contamination\n\t- Another one is water pipes\n\t- **How to remove:** precipitation reaction\n\t\t- Heavy metal cation  is identified\n\t\t- A soluble compound containing an insoluble compound with the cation of the heavy metal is selected\n\t\t- A solution of the compound is added to the water\n\t\t- A precipitation with the heavy metal is produced\n\t\t- Precipitate is filtered off\n- Water monitoring:\n\t- Protocols for water sampling:\n\t\t- The container can be rinsed with the sample before the final sample is taken\n\t\t- The container should be cleaned before taking another sample\n\t\t- The water used for cleaning the container can be tested to ensure there is no contamination between samples.\n\t- Note that if pathogens are being tested for, the container should be sterile\n| Condition                                        | Sampling method                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| sample taken from a well-mixed body of water     | sampling near the surface is sufficient to obtain a representative sample.

This **removes any remaining suspended matter**\n\t\t- **Chlorination:** Gaseous chlorine is added to kill any **biological contaminants**. \n\t\t- After this process, water is now **fit for human consumption**. However, water may also undergo **fluoridation**.\n\t\t- **Fluoridation:** Fluoride ($F^{-}$) is added to **drinking** water before it is released from storage.\n\t\t\t- This is done by adding compounds such as:\n\t\t\t\t- Sodium hexafluorosilicate ($Na_2SiF_6$)\n\t\t\t\t- Fluosilicic acid ($H_2SiF_6$)\n\t\t\t\t- Sodium fluoride ($NaF$)\n\t\t\t- They break down into Fluoride ions in water.\n\t\t- Fluoride reacts with tooth enamel to produce fluorapatite, a stronger more resistant compound. In doing so, tooth decay is reduced.\n\n### 15.2 Properties of water\n- hydrogen bondssssss ::::::::::::::::::::::::))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))\n- **Density in the liquid and solid states**:\n\t- Water **expands** as it freezes.\n\t- Water has a **lower** density as a solid than as a liquid.\n\t- In the liquid state, water molecules move randomly and freely with some hydrogen bonds.\n\t- In the solid state, water forms large hexagonal lattices, which take up more space. Thus water expands, and has a lower density as it freezes.\n- **High surface tension**:\n\t- At the surface of water, molecules are not encased in other water molecules. As a result, hydrogen bonds form between molecules to their side and below them, but not above.\n\t- The sideways forces result in a balance, however due to there being hydrogen bonds below the molecule and not the top, there is an imbalance and molecules at the surface are pulled downwards towards the bulk of the water molecules.\n\t- This downwards force is very fast, and molecules at the surface only spend $1 \\times 10^{-9}$ seconds or 1 nanosecond before being pulled into the bulk of the liquid.\n\t- **Surface tension is a measure of the resistance of a liquid to increase its surface area**. \n\t- As a result of water particles at the surface being pulled towards the bulk of the liquid, water tends not to increase surface area as that would lead to more molecules being pulled towards the bulk, which is energetically unfavourable.\n\t- Thus, water has a high surface tension.\n- **Heat capacity**:\n\t- **Heat capacity - a measure of a substance's capacity of absorb and store heat energy.**\n\t- When heated with a specific amount of energy, water tends to change temperature slower than other substances, such as ethanediol.\n```ad-info\n**Specific heat capacity:** the amount of energy (in joules) needed to increase the temperature of a certain amount (usually 1 gram) of a substance by 1 $\\degree C$\n```\n- Units for specific heat capacity: $J \\ g^{-1} \\ \\degree C^{-1}$\n- **Specific heat capacity** reflects the **type of bonding**. For covalent substances, it reflects the **strength of intermolecular forces between molecules.**\n- **Equation for calculating specific heat capacity:** $q = C \\times m \\times \\Delta T$\n\t- q = amount of heat energy\n\t- C = specific heat capacity (of the substance)\n\t- m = mass\n\t- $\\Delta T$ = temperature change\n- When you heat a substance to change its state of matter, temperature would increase at it approaches the melting point, then it remains constant as the solid melts, then temperature increases as it reaches the boiling point, and once again remains constant as the liquid evaporates.\n\t- ![[Pasted image 20220719195552.png]] \n\t- **Latent heat is the energy required to change a fixed amount of substance, from a solid to liquid or liquid to gas. During this period, temperature does not change**\n\t- **Latent heat of...**\n\t\t- **Fusion:** heat needed to change **1 mol** of substance from solid to liquid at melting point\n\t\t- **Vaporisation** heat needed to change **1 mol** of substance from liquid to gas at boiling point\n### 15.3 Water as a solvent\n- The more polar a compound is, the more likely the compound is to dissolve in water.                                                                               \n---\n## References\n- Chapter 5 “Water Quality” from Water: Science and Solutions for Australia Prosser, I.

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to render callouts\nenableCallouts: true\n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden. It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\n\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\n\n\u003e 🔗 Step 3: [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](notes/obsidian.md)\n\n## Previewing Changes\nThis step is purely optional and mostly for those who want to see the published version of their digital garden locally before opening it up to the internet.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Create an Operand Account on [their website](https://operand.ai/).\n2. Go to Dashboard \u003e Settings \u003e Integrations.\n3. Follow the steps to setup the GitHub integration. Operand needs access to GitHub in order to index your digital garden properly!\n4. Head over to Dashboard \u003e Objects and press `(Cmd + K)` to open the omnibar and select 'Create Collection'.\n\t1. Set the 'Collection Label' to something that will help you remember it.\n\t2. You can leave the 'Parent Collection' field empty.\n5. Click into your newly made Collection.\n\t1. Press the 'share' button that looks like three dots connected by lines.\n\t2.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!
