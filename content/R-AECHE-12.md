Limitations of the flame test:

-   Only small number of metal ions can be distinguished in this way as Bunsen flame is not hot enough to excite the electrons of many atoms.
-   It is difficult to distinguish between very similar colours. - copper is green, barium is green, so its hard to distinguish between the two.
-   The colours may also be affected by the presence of traces of other ions. - contamination
-   Ethanol as a flame has a colour (blue with yellow (carbon being burnt))

Barium is greenish blue, Strontium is red, lithium is red, Sodium is yellow, Copper is green.

**Mass Spectrometry:**

-   Uses:
    -   Calculate the relative atomic mass of an element
    -   Identify elements from the mass numbers of the isotopes
    -   Determine the relative molecular mass of a covalent molecule
-   IF you are analysing molecules, the last peak will give you the **molecular mass** of the molecule.
-   Sometimes, when you are ionising and accelerating molecules, you can break apart the covalent bonds.

**Intro to Electronic Configuration:**

-   First shell holds 2 electrons
-   Second shell holds 8 electrons
-   Third shell holds 8 electron (but has reserve space for 10 more)
-   This space is for the **transition metals**
