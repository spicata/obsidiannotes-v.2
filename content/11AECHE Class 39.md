Organic Chemistry:
- Refers to carbon compounds
- Excludes molecules such as $CO_2$, $H_2CO_3$

ane suggests that the compound is **saturated**.

''-anes' are of the same general formula: $C_nH_{2n+2}$

These are called **alkanes**.

They are known as **homologous groups**
- homo meaning "same"
- same general formula
- similar chemical properties
- Consecutive members differ by one another by $CH_2$ (1 Carbon 2 Hydrogen)

Carbon has unique ability to bond to itself
**Why?** 
- Carbon has a valency of four. It has 4 electrons in a valency shell

Can bond with sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, halogens, etc.

A carbon atom with four single, covalent bonds, has a **tetrahedral shape**. 

**How to express structure?**
- Lewis dot diagrams
- Molecular formula
	- **Total number of atoms of each element present in compound**
- Empirical formula
	- Number of each unique atom in simplest whole number ratio in a compound
- Structural formula
	- **Shows all details. All atoms and all bonds.**
- Condensed formula
	- e.g. $CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_3$
	- You can also do $CH_3(CH_2)_2CH_3$
	- Note for $CH_3CH(CH_3)CH_3$, you place the side chain inside brackets.
- Skeletal formula
	- For 'super complicated molecules' - Ms Pilling
	- 'Its a bit disappointing' - Ms Pilling
	- 'I wish they brought alcohols into yr 11' - Ms Pilling
- Name:
	- e.g. Butane

**Saturated means that contains C-C bonds that are single bonds.**

Alkanes: **saturated hydrocarbons**

**Hydrocarbons**: **only contains** carbon and hydrogen atoms.

**Isomerism**:
- Butane and methylpropane are **structural isomers**.
- Isomers: Same molecular formula, different structural formula.
