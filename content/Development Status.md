Essentially, the purpose of this website was to allow all my 'informational' notes to be active. I'm gonna try to work on the website somewhat frequently, but not excessively, so don't expect it to be amazingly good or something.

Also, there will be broken links and weird formatting, and things like that. I'm not that great of a coder, and also the majority of the notes  are old and thus are not formatted.

I will be making quite drastic changes to this website, e.g. style, formatting etc. in the coming weeks. I estimate that hopefully by **September**, the website should be running pretty smoothly.

I am currently doing some *spring cleaning* of the website, so I will be going around and fixing all the broken links and stuff.

Hello! Couldn't wait a week to write another one of these. Just wanted to say that hopefully all images should be working right now, thanks to some epic javascript by Osacr, who is a member of the notes coalition. I will start begging Osacr to help with highlights, but in the mean time I probably won't be working on this project excessively. I'm not abandoning it though. Don't worry.

So it turns out that my formula for note taking isn't the slightest bit helpful because there aren't exactly clear links to stuff yet... Well I plan to fix this via republishing my Obsidian vault to Github (yes it was up in the first place), but I haven't gotten around to purging the vault of some personal stuff. 

Normally, this would be fine, but because people like Tag exist and Tag likes to take other people's notes without asking them, I've had to private the repository. Give me a few days and it'll be back soon. :)



/\\ Proof that I am not capping and the repo exists. I mean, how else would this website exist???
