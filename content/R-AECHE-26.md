Moles and Stoichiometry:
* Water: 0.24978
* Cobalt: 0.035635
* Sulfur: 0.035558
* Oxygen: 0.1425 per O

$\therefore$ the empirical formula of the hydrated compound is $CuSO_4.7H_2O$


%C = 40%
%H = 6.7%
%O = 53.3%

> [!NOTE] Post-writing Commentary
> Empirical formula sucks :( I mean its still my fault for thinking a hydrated salt can exist as 2: $Al(NO_3)_3$ to 31: $H_{2}O$ or something like that
