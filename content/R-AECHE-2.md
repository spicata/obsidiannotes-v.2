Objective 8 - Properties of matter:

-   **Element - only one type of atom, contain same number of protons**
-   **Compound - a substance with 2 or more elements (different) chemically bonded together**
    -   e.g. $Cl_2$ is not a compound, there are 2 atoms bonded but they are not different.
    -   Thus, $Cl_2$ is an element. (Note $Cl_2$ is found in nature rather than Cl.)
    -   $NaCl$ is a compound. They form an ionic bond, and they are different.

Sodium chloride is a lot of sodium ions attracted to chloride ions, which are attracted to sodium ions. This forms NaCl as a lattice (Note: lattice only refers to ionic compounds), as these ions occur in an equal ratio.

-   **Molecules: Elements bonded covalently.**
-   e.g. $Cl_2$ is a molecule
-   $SO_2$ is a molecule. also, it is a compound.

**Atom:**

-   Smallest particle of an element that can exist on its own.

**Molecule:**

-   A particle containing two or more atoms joined together by covalent bonds. - has to involve non-metals. - by definition, considering covalent bonds
-   Examples: $CO_2$, $H_2O$, $H_2$, $I_2$

**Ion:**

-   An atom or groups of atoms that has become positively or negatively charged by losing or gaining electrons.
    -   Positively charged - cation (+ve) - formed by losing electrons
        -   Examples, any metal, $NH4^+$
    -   Negatively charged - anion (-ve) - formed by gaining electrons
        -   Examples: $CO_2^{-2}$
    -   anions are attracted to cathodes - Michael Faraday

**Mass of conservation: no matter can be created nor destroyed.**

**Element:**

-   The simplest kind of substance that cannot be broken down into anything simpler. All its atoms have the same number of protons
-   All its atoms have the same number of protons.

**Compound:**

-   A substance made from two or more different elements chemically combined together.

**Chemical symbol**

-   Letter of pair of letters used to represent an element
-   Examples, S, Fe

**Chemical formulae:**

-   The molecular formula gives the total number of atoms of each element present in one **molecule**.
-   Examples - $N_2$, $C_6H_{12}O_6$
-   The empirical formula gives the simples whole number ratio of atoms of each element present in a **compound**
-   Examples - $Na^+Cl^-$ , $CH_2O$
-   Chemical formula includes both molecular and empirical.

**Stoichiometry is a ratio of substances in an equation when they react.**

-   When you balance a formula, you put **stoichiometric coefficients.**
-   It is used in calculations.
-   The relationship between the relative quantities of substances taking part in a chemical reaction.

**Chemical equation:**

-   Shows the reactants taking part in a chemical reaction and the products from the reactants in the correct proportions.
-   Reactants are on the left, and products are on the right.

**Pure substances:**

-   Have a fixed or constant composition
-   Cannot be separated by physical means
-   Have well defined physical properties, e.g.:
    -   melting point
    -   boiling point
    -   hardness
    -   density
    -   colour
    -   solubility
    -   conductivity
-   Have constant chemical properties.

**Mixtures:**

-   contains two or more different substances, in proportions that can vary
-   properties vary with composition, depends on the identity and amounts of constituents/substances
-   properties of individual constituents/substances can be used to separate the mixture

**Homogenous materials:**

-   have uniform composition throughout
-   includes all pure substances (elements and compounds) and some mixtures
-   the only kind of mixture that is homogenous is a solution e.g. salt water

**Heterogenous materials:**

-   heterogenous materials are non-uniform - you can see differences from one section to another
-   the constituents are physically separated, e.g. in a different phase
-   Examples include:
    -   Granite (mixtures of different mineral grains)
    -   Milk (fat globules suspended in water)
    -   Toothpaste (solid particles suspended in liquid)

**Solution:**

-   Where a minor component (the solute) is uniformly distributed within a major component which is usually a liquid (the solvent)

**3 States of matter:**

-   Solid - molecules are closely bonded together, usually in firm chemical structures. Low kinetic energy - has fixed volume
-   Liquid - molecules are loosely bonded together, there are some small chemical bonds, flows freely and is not found in firm states. Medium kinetic energy - has fixed volume
-   Gas - weak attraction in molecules, high kinetic energy. Gasses attempt to fill the space of their containment.

**Processes of change:**

-   Gas to liquid - condensation
-   Liquid to gas - evaporation
-   Solid to liquid - melting
-   Liquid to solid - freezing/solidification
-   Solid to gas - sublimation
-   Gas to solid - deposition

**Classification of matter:**

Note - mixtures can be separated into pure substances using differences in physical properties.

**Pure substances:**

Note - compounds are separated by chemical means

-   Compounds
-   Elements

**Mixtures:**

-   Homogenous mixtures - you can shine light through a mixture, if it passes through and light does not change, it is homogenous
-   Heterogenous mixtures - if light scatters, it is heterogenous


**Solutions (aq) are mixtures!!! :) thank you ethan widjaja**
