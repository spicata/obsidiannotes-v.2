-   The absorption spectra and emission spectra for each element superimpose exactly.
-   Each element’s energy levels are slightly different, no two elements have the same spectra.

Absorption and emission spectra can be used to identify elements as each element’s spectra are unique. This is due to the differing nuclear charge on each atom.

The intensity of the absorption or emission lines tells you the abundance of the element. - this means concentration in a mixture.

Flame test: uses emission spectra

**Mass spectrometry:**

-   Used in the exploration of space
