**Types of Intermolecular Forces**:
Note: Intermolecular means *between* molecules.
- Are electrostatic (attraction between oppositely charged particles)

* Dispersion forces (van der Waals' forces, London forces)
	* Don't call them weak, because it's all relative
	* Must show more than 1 molecule if drawing a diagram
* Dipole-dipole interaction
* Hydrogen bonding

For molecules at a relatively similar size:
* Dispersion forces are weakest
* Dipole-dipole is of medium strength
* Hydrogen bonding is strongest

For molecules that are **non-polar**:
- Dispersion forces are the only intermolecular forces acting upon their molecules.
