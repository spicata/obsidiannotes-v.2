To determine whether something is polar or non-polar, you have to take into account the following:
* relative **electronegativity** of composite atoms
* shape of molecule

Looking at **symmetry** of charges, not the symmetry of molecules.

Dipole is cancelled. 

Dipole refers to the slightly negative/positive areas of a molecule

**Periodic Trends**:
* Electronegativity **increases** across a period because:
1. The atomic radius **decreases**. 
2. The charge of the nucleus **increases** without significant extra shielding. New electrons do not contribute much to shielding because they are added to the same principal energy level across the period.

* Electronegativity **decreases** down a period because:
1. The atomic radius **increases**.
2. Although the charge on the nucleus increases, shielding also **increases** significantly. This is because electrons added down the group fill new principle electron levels.

**Ionisation Energy**:
* Upon applying energy, solids will turn into liquids, which will turn into gas.
* This is called vaporisation.
* If energy is continuously applied, a gas becomes an ion.
* However, there are two processes for the two types of ion.
* For the cation process, energy is absorbed.
* For the anion process, energy is released.
* Ionisation energy is:
	* Energy required to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of gaseous atoms.

e.g. $X_{g} \rightarrow X^+_{g}+\bar e^-$

**The first ionisation energy of an element is the energy required to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of gaseous atoms.**

The first ionisation energy is therefore a measure of the strength of the attraction between the outermost electron and the nucleus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

**Effective nuclear charge** = **Nuclear charge** - **shielding**.

Going across a period, nuclear charge increases.

When atomic radius decreases, electrons become closer and closer to the nucleus. Thus, it would be difficult to remove electrons from an atom. 

**There is a general increase in the first ionisation energies across periods.**

Across period 3, the proton number increases but the amount of shielding does not change significantly. 
The effective nuclear charge **increases**.

The greater attraction between the nucleus and the outermost electrons mean

Outer electrons are closer to the nucleus, thus they will experience **stronger nuclear attraction**, and thus will require more energy to remove from an atom.

**Always mention more/less energy required!!!!**

**Bonding**
