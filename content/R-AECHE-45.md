**Empirical Formula for combustion:**
- $C_xH_yO_{z}+ (x+y-z)O_{2} \rightarrow xCO_{2} + \frac{1}{2}yH_2O$

The Ideal Gas Law is used to determine the molar mass and from that the molecular formula

$PV = nRT$
$n = \frac{PV}{RT}$

P = kPa
V = L
R = 8.314
T = K ($\degree C + 273.15$)

Given mass of substance, and by figuring out moles, you can find its molar mass.
