Properties of Alkanes
- 3-ethylhexane
- C8H18
- C4H9

Chemical Properties:
- Combustion, alkanes are commonly used as fuels. 
- Substitution reaction
	- $C_2H_6$ + $Br_2$ $\rightarrow (UV light)$ $C_2H_5Br$ + $HBr$
	- In the absence of light, reaction does not occur.
	- You need UV light for the reaction to occur.
	- Note the name of the produced is bromoethane
	- $C_{2}H_{5}Br + Br_{2} \rightarrow C_2H_{4}Br_{2} + HBr$
	- We cannot predict where the second bromine will be located. This is **uncontrollable**.
	- For example, it could be 1,1-dibromoethane or 1,2-dibromoethane
- *First carbon is the one with interesting things happening around it.*
