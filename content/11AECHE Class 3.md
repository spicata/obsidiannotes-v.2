Practical 1 - Homogenous and Heterogenous mixtures\:

Page 10 STAWA Book

Procedure:

![[Notions Table 1.png]]
C:

Test the solubility of a small sample (half a teaspoon) of ethanol, charcoal, sodium chloride and copper (II) chloride in separate 15 mL lots of distilled water. Record your observations and classify each sample as soluble or insoluble in the ‘water(solvent)’ column of a table similar to that shown.

![[Notions Table 2.png]]

Use solubility to separate different solids. If you find a solvent which dissolves one but not the other, you can add it to the solids, the one that dissolves will create a solution - note this is called filtrate - and the one that does not will stay solid. Then you can use filtration methods and then crystalize the solid in the solution.

Note - research physical properties
