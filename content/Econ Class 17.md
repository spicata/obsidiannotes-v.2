## Living Standards
**Definition of Living Standards**
The quality of housing, material wellbeing (goods and services) and wealth available to be experienced by an individual or a group to fulfil certain needs and wants. There are numerous indexes by which living standard can be measured, such as:
- Class disparity
- Poverty rate
- Quality and affordability of housing
- Hours of work required to purchase necessities
- GDP
- Affordable access to quality healthcare
- Quality and availability of education
- Incidence of disease
- Infrastructure
- National economic growth
- Economic and political stability
- Political and religious freedom
- Environmental quality
- Climate
- Safety

**Definition of Poverty**
A state or condition in which an individual or group lacks the financial resources required to achieve and maintain a minimum living standard


$N(t) = N_{0}\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{t}{t_{1/2}}}$

N(t) = final number of stuff
N(0) = initial number of stuff
t = time taken to reach final num.
$t_{1/2}$ = **halflife of sample**

e.g say sample x has a half life of 2 years, initial = 80%, final = 10%, r $\therefore$

$10 = 80\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{t}{2}}$
$\frac{10}{80} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{t}{2}}$
$\log_{2}(\frac{1}{8}) = \log_{2}(\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{t}{2}})$
$\log_{2}(2^{-3}) = \log_{2}(\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{t}{2}})$
$-3\log_{2}(2) = \log_{2}(\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{t}{2}})$
$-3 = \log_{2}(\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{t}{2}})$
$-3 = \frac{t}{2}\log_{2}(\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{})$
$-3 = \frac{t}{2}\log_{2}(2^{-1})$
$-3 = -1\frac{t}{2}\log_{2}(2)$
$-3 = -1\frac{t}{2}$
$3 = \frac{t}{2}$
$t=  6$
