**Bonding:**
* Three distant substances:
	* Na(s) - Metallic (metal only)
	* NaCl (s) - Ionic (metal and non-metal)
	* Cl_2 (g) - Covalent (non-metal only)
* Metalloids can have both metallic and non-metal properties.

* In metallic bonding, valence electrons become delocalised.
* Delocalised vs localised: Delocalised means the electron doesn't belong to any atom. It becomes mobile. Localised means it is part of a local atom.


**Properties of Metals**:
* Chemical Properties:
	* Reactivity
		1. Consider electronic configuration, position on periodic table etc.
* Physical properties (focus on this):
	* melting point
	* boiling point
	* density
	* electrical and thermal conductivity
	* malleability
	* ductile

**Metallic Bonding**:
* Why is the melting point of metals high?
	* Note - all metals are solid except mercury
* Melting point means you have particles that are closer together that are separated into a looser arrangements where particles are further apart. i.e. Solid -> liquid.

* **Any type of bonding is electrostatic force of attraction (for this section, wait till you get to intermolecular forces L)**

* e.g. in Metallic bonding, there is a **stronger** electrostatic attraction between cations of metal and the sea of delocalised electrons **in a network**, if the metal has a higher melting point.
* When describing melting point, **write about heat energy required**.
* Solid -> liquid is ions, liquid -> gas is atoms.

It takes more energy to separate ions of metal if you have a higher melting point. This is due to a stronger electrostatic attraction between ions of metals and the sea of delocalised electrons in a network.

* Liquid metals also conduct electricity, so liquid metals still have a sea of delocalised electrons.

**Melting point**
* Why do some metals have high melting points, and why do other have lower ones?
* Aluminium has a significantly higher melting point.
* Aluminium's electronic configuration: $2,8,3$.
	* Thus, each atom of aluminium has 3 electrons it can **delocalise**.
* Therefore, in a diagram, cations have a charge of 3+, and there are more electrons than sodium. 
* Thus, there is a stronger electrostatic attraction between cations and the sea of delocalised electrons.
* This logic follows for density. - **Low charge = low density**

**Electrical conductivity**:
* In metals, **electrons** conduct electricity. **Specifically, the delocalised ones**(because they are mobile).
* Gasses on its own are not electrically conductive.

**Malleability**:
* The ability for metal to be bent into shapes
* If you apply force in a metallic network, you **do not** break the structure.
* The sea of delocalised electrons are **non-directional**. Thus, when you apply force cations slide around in a sea of delocalised electrons.
* The structure does not break, as the structure is **rigid**.

**Ductility**:
* Quality of metals that allows metals to be pulled into wires.
* When producing a wire, the cations just move into a linear shape, surrounded by the sea of delocalised electrons in a network.

**Ionic Bonding**:
* If a compound has a metal and a non-metal, it is ionic.
* Typical behaviour: solid at room temperature.

* Noble gases are chemically stable because they have full outer shells of electrons.
* s-block elements lose one or more electrons to form stable cations (positively charged ions).
* There is a transfer of electrons from metal atoms to non-metal atoms to form anions and cations with stable electronic configurations.
* p-block elements gain one or more electrons to form stable anions (negatively charged ions).
* There is a transfer of electrons from metal atoms to non-metal atoms to form anions and cations with stable electronic configurations.

yea ms pilling is the kind of teacher to teach an entire chem topic in a single lesson

Note: **Most metals are found on the left side. As discussed previously in the Periodicity section, elements on the left have a lower ionisation(first + others) energy. This is essential as there must be little energy required to ionise metal atoms to produce cations and a sea of delocalised electrons**
