# Econ Class 16

## The Transmission of Monetary Policy
The RBA changed cash rate, which influences interest rates.

The change in **interest rates** translates through an economy. This is what we analyse.

It is transmitted through 4 channels:
- Consumption/Saving and Investment
	- When RBA **raises** cash rate, the banks (Commonwealth, ANZ, etc.) will raise interest rates, *on savings and loans*. They can only change interest rates for savings and loans. 
	- 2 Types of loans:
		- Household loans, things to buy a house/car
		- Business loans, loans for businesses for investment
	- This is why its called savings and investment channel, as loans tend to be considered for investments.
	- Increasing cash rates, mean interest rates increase. This means borrowing money costs more, and thus people are less inclined to borrow.

- Wealth
- Balance sheet and cash flow
