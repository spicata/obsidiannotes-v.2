# Econ Class 16

## The Transmission of Monetary Policy
The RBA changed cash rate, which influences interest rates.

The change in **interest rates** translates through an economy. This is what we analyse.

It is transmitted through 4 channels:
- Consumption/Saving and Investment
	- When RBA **raises** cash rate, the banks (Commonwealth, ANZ, etc.) will raise interest rates, *on savings and loans*. They can only change interest rates for savings and loans. 
	- 2 Types of loans:
		- Household loans, things to buy a house/car
		- Business loans, loans for businesses for investment
	- This is why its called savings and investment channel, as loans tend to be considered for investments.
	- Increasing cash rates, mean interest rates increase. This means borrowing money costs more, and thus people are less inclined to borrow.
	- You can get fixed rates for mortgages, but have some inclusions (e.g. the interest rate for this is higher than the current variable rate)
	- There is a profit margin, i.e. even if the cash rate is 0.1%, banks will still have variable rate of 2-3%, as this is how they make money.
	- When you save, the money goes in a bank, which is loaned out at a higher rate than your savings interest rate. 
	- Thus, when cash rate increases, savings increase while loaning decrease.
	- Thus, aggregate demand decreases as people tend to save their money rather than loan to buy things like houses.
