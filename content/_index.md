## Hello!

Welcome to my website! I'm [Ed](about.md), and this website is essentially **Obsidian Publish on steroids**, i.e. *this is where I publish my obsidian notes*. 

The website runs using **Github pages** and **quartz**, with special thanks to Jacky Zhao [(here is the github page)](https://github.com/jackyzha0), who essentially wrote all the code, did all the hard work, while I've just stolen it. :)

Anyways, the point of this website is to make education free and accessible, as it should be. I will be uploading my generic class notes here, alongside some more refined subject-specific notes, such as methods, spec and chem.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that methods and specialist notes will probably be very bad, as you really should be making notes on these subjects yourself. However, the chemistry notes will be of moderate quality, and will be good to read in your spare time if you aren't exactly learning the topics in class.

**All current notes are available at [Notes](Notes.md)** 
 
You may also wish to peruse through some sister-sites of this website, which I wholly recommend you do. Especially *"spicata"*'s one. You'll find them all [here](https://notes-coalition.github.io/).

I recommend looking through the [topic notes](11AECHE%20Topic%20Notes.md) above all, as most of the [class notes](11AECHE%20Class%20Notes.md) are unformatted, and the [published notes](11AECHE%20Published%20Notes.md) is looking quite barren. Please note however, I am yet to fully transition to a topic-style system when writing notes, so most of the topic notes have nothing in them. Do check out [Electron Configuration](Electron%20Configuration.md), I think its the only one with stuff.

> Here you will learn the most crucial concept in chemistry.

**Note:** The *Table of Contents* section for all the class notes will be pretty scuffed.  Kindly ignore them.

You may also enjoy perusing my [Yr11 Chemistry textbook review](Chemistry%20Resources%20review.md).

**Note:** The monkey face was chosen by Atharva Sathe. :)

#### IMPORTANT!

This website is in the development stage. There will definitely be some unformatted pages, and the whole thing is rather experimental. Check out the development status [here](Development%20Status.md)!

Thanks for reading! I hope this website is somewhat useful to you.
