## Gini Coefficient
Number between 1 to 0, the greater the curve of the Lorenz curve, the greater the Gini coefficient. As the Gini coefficient approaches 1, the more unequal the population is.

**We do not need to construct it, but we need to understand the concept of the curve/Gini coefficient.**
