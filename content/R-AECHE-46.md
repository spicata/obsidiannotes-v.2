Oxidation is Loss,
Reduction is Reduced
**OILRIG**

We need to identify when a substance is oxidised or reduced, this is assisted via the use of **oxidation numbers**.

Electrical energy is produced from potential chemical energy.

There are many types of batteries,
- secondary
- primary
- fuel cells

## Oxidisation Numbers
Shows number of electrons **lost**, **gained**, or ***shared unequally***.

- Chlorine: Covalent bond, electrons *shared equally*, therefore oxidisation number is 0.
- $HCl_{(aq)}$: $H$: +, $Cl$: -
	- Shared unequally, thus $Cl$ is -1 (more electronegative), $H$ is +1.
- Simple Ion: **Oxidisation number same as charge of ion!**
	- Only mono-atomic ions?
	- Single atom
- $MgCl_{2}$: $Mg$: +2, $Cl$: -1
- $AlCl_{3}$: $Al$: +3, $Cl$: -1
- $Al_{(s)}$: 0, although electrons are delocalised, the metal is still neutral; electrons aren't transferred to another substance.
- $Br_{2}$: 0, Shared equally.
- $H_{2}O$: $H$: +1, $O$: -2, $H_{2}O$: 0
- $H_{2}O_{2}$: $H$: +1, $O$: -1
	- Drawing Lewis diagram, one sees that Oxygen bonds to 1 Hydrogen and 1 Oxygen. The Oxygen-Oxygen bond is equal, and thus there is only 1 electron being unequally shared.
	- This is the only case where oxygen has an oxidisation number of -1.
### Rules of Oxidisation Number:
- **IF** you have uncombined element/element combined with itself, *oxidation number/state* is **0**.
- **IF** you have simple ions, the *oxidation number/station* is **charge of ion**.
- **For neutral compounds, the sum of the oxidation states is 0**
- Elements with **fixed oxidation states:**
	- Hydrogen (except with metal hydrides): +1 (-1)
	- Oxygen (except in peroxides): -2 (-1)
	- Group 1 elements: +1
	- Group 2 elements: +2
	- Aluminium: +3
	- Halides: -1

Examples:
$CuO$ - $Cu$: +2, $O$: -2
Note that this is Copper (II) Oxide.
- The (II) in this case is its oxidation number

Sodium Chlorate (I).
- $Na$: +1
- $ClO$: -1
	- Cl: +1
	- O: -2
- In this case, the (I) is for the Cl!!

Sodium Chlorate (?)
- ClO3: -1
- Cl: +5
- O:-2

	$\therefore$ The oxidation state for Cl is (V)


$SO^{-2}_{3}$: $S$: +4

Zinc + Copper (ii) Sulfate ->
- Molecular eq
	- $Zn_{(s)} + CuSO_{4(aq)} \to ZnSO_{4(aq)} + Cu_{(s)}$
- Ionic eq
	- $Zn_{(s)} + Cu^{2+}_{(aq)} \to Zn^{2+}_{(aq)} + Cu_{(s)}$
- What is oxidised? What is reduced?
	- Zinc is oxidised, Copper **in $CuSO_4$ solution(or $Cu^{2+}$ ions)** is reduced.

$Mg_{(s)} + 2H^{+}_{(aq)} \to Mg^{2+}_{{(aq)}} + H_{2(g)}$

Mg is the reducing agent, $H_{2}SO_4$ (NOT $H^{+}$ CAN WRITE $H^{+}$ **IN** $H_{2}SO_4$) solution is the oxidising agent.

- $Mg_{{(s)}} \to Mg_{(aq)}^{2+} + 2\overline{e}$
- $2H^{+}_{(aq)} + 2\overline{e} \to H_{2(aq)}$

$Cu^{2+}$ in $CuCl_{2}$ is the oxidising agent, $SO_{2}$ is the reducing agent

$H_2SO_4$ is oxidising agent, $HI$ is reducing agent.

c) $HI + H_2SO_4 \to H_2S + 4H_2O + 4I_2$

- $2I^{-} \to I_{2} + 2\overline{e}$
- $10H^{+} + SO_{4}^{2-} + 8\overline{e}\to H_{2}S +4 H_{2}O$

$MnO_{4}^{-} + 8H^{+} + 5\overline{e} \to Mn^{2+} + 4H_{2}O$
$5Fe^{2+} \to 5Fe^{3+} + 5\overline{e}$
$MnO_{4}^{-} + 8H^{+} + 5Fe^{2+} \to Mn^{2+} + 4H_{2}O + 5Fe^{3+}$

### Galvanic Cells
- $Zn_{(s)} + CuSO_{4(aq)} \to ZnSO_{4(aq)} + Cu_{(s)}$
- Spontaneous reaction: happens at room temperature, on its own
- $Zn_{(s)} \to Zn^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2\overline{e}$
- $Cu^{+}_{(aq)} + 2\overline{e}\to Cu_{(s)}$
