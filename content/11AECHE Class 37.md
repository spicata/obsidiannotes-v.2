# 11AECHE Class 37


Definition of pH: $-log[H^+]$
- $[H^+]$ concentration in mol L$^{-1}$

Therefore, $[H^{+}]=10^{-pH}$

**DONT USE pOH MS PILLING DOES NOT LIKE pOH**

$K_w$: ionic product of water at 25$\degree$c. ($1 \times 10^{-14}$)

IF THEY DON'T GIVE YOU TEMPERATURE ALWAYS ASSUME ITS 25

Use $[H^{+}] = \frac{K_w}{[OH^-]}$
