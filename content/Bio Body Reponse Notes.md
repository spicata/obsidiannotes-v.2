## Inflammation/Inflammatory Response
- Skin is broken. Non-specific immune response occurs. This is an example of mechanical damage.
- Specialised leukocytes, **mast cells**, are activated and cause ***several chemicals*** to be released, such as:
	- **histamine**:
		- Increases blood flow to the area through vasodilation.
		- Walls of capillaries become more permeable. 
		- Result: Increased blood flow, indicated by *redness* and *heat*.
			- Escape of fluid causes swelling.
	- **heparin**: Prevents clotting in the immediate area of injury.
- Chemicals released by most cells increase phagocytes to the area 
- $\to$ engulf micro-organisms + cell debris.
- Damaged tissue stimulate pain receptors causing pain.
- Dead phagocytes and tissues fluid form pus (a yellowy fluid)
- New cells are formed by mitosis repair tissue.

## Fever
- Pathogens infecting the body result in the elevation of high temperature, called a fever.
- Due to infection, the hypothalamus sets the body temperature to a higher point (new set point)
- The infected person feels cold causing:
	- **Shiver**: Muscles contract + relax to generate heat
	- **Vasoconstriction(in the skin)**: blood vessels marrow to reduce blood flow and conserve heat.
	- Result: body temperature increases.
- Eventually the fever breaks, called **the crisis**, so the hypothalamus resets body temperature to normal ($36.4 \degree C$)
- The person feels hot, so:
	- **Sweating**: Evaporation of sweat cools the body down.
	- **Vasodilation in skin**: blood vessels widen to increase heat loss by radiation, conduction (+2% convection)
- Body cools down.
- *Purpose of the fever is to kill of the pathogens.*
