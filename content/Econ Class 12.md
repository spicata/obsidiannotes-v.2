# Econ Class 12

## Difference between Discretionary and Non-Discretionary Fiscal Policy

Unemployment benefits are **automatic stabilisers**. 
When people lose their job, they go to centerlink, and apply for unemployment benefits, are and **automatically** given unemployment
- Government automatically loses revenue (you pay less or no tax)

Unemployment benefits give people money, so that a stable amount of *economic activity* is maintained.

Automatic stabilisers smoothen fluctuations in the BTC, as when downturn occurs, more people get unemployment benefits, and will still create economic activity.

Discretionary: **required government intervention**.
- They deliberately change their expenditure and revenue. This *requires legislation*.

What government intervention is:
- Changing tax revenue
	- **Direct tax**: The individual/entity charged has to pay the tax directly
		- Cannot be shifted to other individuals
		- Examples include personal income tax and corporate income tax
	- **Indirect tax**: e.g. GST, individuals are charged with a tax, but give it to a third party, which is given to the government.
		- E.g. GST, levied on a supermarket but the consumer pays it.
- Changing government expenditure
	- Spend on goods and services
		- *Infrastructure* is probably the **best** investment!!
	- Spend on **transfer payments** (????)
