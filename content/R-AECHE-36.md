# 11AECHE Class 36

**Acid + Bases**
```ad-info

Arrhenius acid: A substance that ionises into hydrogen ions in an **aqueous solution**
```
- e.g. $HCl_{(aq)}+H_2O_{(l)} \rightarrow H_3O^{+_{(aq)}}+ Cl^-_{(aq)}$
```ad-info
Arrhenius base: A substance that dissociates into OH- ions in an aqueous solution (**Weak bases ionise**)

```


- Acid + metal -> salt + $H_{2(g)}$
- Acid + metal oxide -> salt + water
- Acid + metal hydroxide -> salt + water
- Acid + metal carbonate -> salt + $CO_{2(g)}$ + water

Explanation:
- HCl is strong acid, thus will dissociate fully
- CH3COOH is a weak acid, and will dissociate partially.
- Thus, HCl will have a stronger concentration of charged particles in comparison to CH3COOH.
- Thus, as strength in conductivity increases with concentration of charged particles in solution, HCl will be a stronger electrical conductor.
