C-C and C-H bonds are considered **non-polar**.

Complete combustion happens when oxygen in excess, this is the **main** form of combustion
- $CO_2$ is produced

Incomplete combustion occurs in a limited supply of oxygen.
- $C$ or $CO$ is produced

Alkanes undergo **substitution reactions**.

In terms of halogens, we only care about $Cl_2,Br_2,I_2$ for organic chemistry, as they have colours in their aqueous form which we can use to identify reactions.
