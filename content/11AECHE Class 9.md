Bring in book on Wednesday!

Separation Techniques homework!!!

Structure of the atom & nanomaterials

**Electronic configuration:**

n = 1 - really strong attraction , n = principle quantum number

goes all the way to n = 6

n = 1 can only hold 2 electrons

n = 2 can hold 8

Aufbau principle??

**Big formula!!!**

Max electrons in an electron level = $2n^2$

Electron absorption/emissions spectra:

n = 1 is the ground state of all electrons. It can be excited using light, heat, and electrical discharge.

Light is calculated using the formula $c = u\lambda$

c = speed of light

u = frequency

$\lambda$ = wavelength

Maxwell’s law!!

Just because highest energy level is n = 1, it doesn’t mean that there isn’t n = 2, → 5 -> $\infty$



absorption only occurs between particular wavelength, THERE IS NOTHING IN BETWEEN

Bohr’s model was helpful:

-   Explained atomic spectra
-   Gave a model for electronic structure.

It was also revolutionary:

-   Used ideas of quantisation of energy, electrons can only have certain amounts of energy (quanta)
- Linked chemistry to quantum physics

> [!info]
> Niels Bohr was a Danish physicist and is considered one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics, precisely old quantum mechanics
> 
> During the Nazi occupation of Denmark in World War II, Bohr escaped to the United States, where he became associated with the Atomic Energy Project.
> 
> In his final years, he devoted himself to the peaceful application of atomic physics.

Visible spectra (light)

Isaac Newton was a founding father of modern optics, discovered you can use prisms to split white light and see the visible spectrum.

When light shines through a prism, the light separates into pattern of colours, the pattern of colours is called a spectrum. Each colour of spectrum represents different wave lengths.

**memorise the order of colours in spectrum!!**
