# Comp Sci 1

Algorithms have a **control structure**.

There are 3 kinds of control structures: 
- Sequence
	- Goes from start to finish
	- e.g.
- Selection
	- There are 3 kinds of selection control structures:
		- Single (IF)
		- Double (IF, ELSE)
		- Multiple (IF, ELIF, ELIF, ELSE)
			- CASE
			- NESTED
- Loops/Iteration/Replication/Repetition
	- While loop -> We call *first test* - **condition** of program is tested at **beginning of program**
	- FOR
		- FIX(ed)
			- Not necessary?

	- RETURN UNTIL -> Test last - program runs at least one time.

How to write control structure:
- Flow chart
	- Visual idea of how the program move
		- Oval - Begin/End of program
		- Parallelogram - Input/Output
		- Square - Process: this is where things are done with the input
		- Kite - condition, if etc.
		- Line - link between these different options
		- **DONT USE X, Y and Z AS VARIABLES**
		- Constant does not change in the code.
- Pseudocode
