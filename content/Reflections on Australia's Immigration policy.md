# Reflections on Australia's Immigration policy

This isn’t just about Australia. This is about a new world that we are seeing come into being before our eyes – a world in which the defence of borders depends on the drawing of new lines between the included and the excluded.

Between citizens and bare lives.

But these are very dangerous times, for what is being redrawn here are the limits of our human community. And the very fragility of those shifting lines means that, one day, any one of us might find ourselves on the outside.
