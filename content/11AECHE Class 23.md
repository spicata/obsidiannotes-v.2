**HOMEWORK:**
* Revise atomic spectra
	* Absorption and emissions spectra
* Structure of an atom

**Diamond vs Graphite**:
* Diamond:
	* In diamond, covalent lattices come from Carbon bonding in a **tetrahedral** shape.
	* 4 covalent bonds per carbon atom
	* $\therefore$  no delocalised electrons or any other charged particles(ions). 
	* **Molecular network**
	* (no **weak** **intermolecular** forces)
	* Thus, diamond has very high melting point.
	* Does not dissolve in water/organic substances
	* **Not** electrically/thermally conductive
* Graphite:
	* 3 covalent bonds per carbon atom
	* 1 **electron becomes delocalised**
	* **Molecular network, *layered***
	* Weak **intermolecular** forces between the layers of graphite
	* Still **high melting/boiling point**, you're still separating the strong covalent bonds (lower than diamond. breaking 3 vs 4)
	* Electrically conductive, not as conductive as metals, however.
	* Soft: you can take the layers, and squash it.
	* Does not dissolve in water, or organic solvents.
		* Why? You need to separate all atoms at the same time, and its not easy to break the many covalent bonds.
	* Can be used as a lubricant


Intermolecular - between molecules (doesn't apply to diamond, it is one big molecule)(**discrete molecules**)

Intramolecular - inside a molecule, i.e. a covalent bond

When you heat up something, (i.e. melting/boiling point), you do **not** break intramolecular forces, but intermolecular forces.

e.g. $H_2O_{(s)} \rightarrow H_2O_{(l)} \rightarrow H_2O_{(g)}$

Not $H_2O_{(l)} \rightarrow H_{2(g)} + O_{2(g)}$ , this is explosive


Thermal conductivity refers to the kinetic energy of a substance's atoms/molecules.


Buckminsterfullerene - $C_{60}$

* Will conduct in particular circumstances
	* Such as in impurities (mixed with other substances)
* Can be used as a lubricant
* Weak van der Waals forces only
	* Black/brown solid is a soft powder
	* Sublimes at 800k 
	* Semiconductor in pure form

**Elements of Period 3:**

* Na - M, N
* Mg - M, N
* Al - M, N
* Si - C, MN
* $P_4$ - C, SM
* $S_8$ - C, SM
* $Cl_2$ - C, SM
* Ar - N/A

Variation in melting points across period 3:
* Increases to silicon (very high in comparison to the increase for metals), gets lower and lower from silicon (steep fall)

Electrical conductivity:
* All metals are very electrically conductive, due to sea of delocalised electrons
* Silicon - can **only** be electrically conductive if in impurities
* Simple molecules - they have no delocalised electrons or charged particles (ions) that move around, therefore zero electrical conductivity.
