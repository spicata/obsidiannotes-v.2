Hypothesis: Link between independent and dependent variable, a prediction about what is going to happen. (observation)
Independent variable.: The variable that is changed. It's the one being investigated. **Where possible, use units!**
Dependent variable: The variable that is measured. **Where possible, put units!**
Control variables: The factors that are kept the same to make it a fair test.
- Preliminary work: Used to identify what factors can been controlled, how to set experiment up, how to minimise uncontrollable variables.
	- Here the accuracy of a method is determined.
Validity: Answering the question posed.
Fair?: All variables are the same except the one we are testing
Reliable: A measure of the extent that the investigation gives the same result, i.e. the consistency of the data
- Repetition: Do it again!
- Replication: Others, using the same equipment, do the same investigation.
Accuracy: Closeness to the true value
 - "Can go down to 25th decimal place" - Holland
Precision: The degree of detail the equipment allows.
Risk assessment: To reduce the chances of inquiry.
Ethical considerations:
- Anonymity
- Confidentiality
- Voluntary participation

A stopwatch records to 2 decimal places (100s of seconds). When using stopwatch, record seconds, rather than 100s or 10s of seconds. 

**Measure equipment!** (in the method)

Justifying your strategy

Don't contradict yourself, using more precise stopwatch is not necessarily an improvement. 
- e.g. average in 3 decimal places, when initial data was measured in whole numbers.

$6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O \to C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$

-4 -4 , 2x +1 -2, C 0

CO_2 is reduced - gain

H_2O is oxidised
