# Properties of matter

## Notes

my generic notes:

Objective 8 - Properties of matter:

-   Element - The **simplest** kind of substance that **cannot be broken down** into anything simpler. All its atoms have the **same number of protons**, and it is only made of **one type of atom.**
-   Compound - a substance with **2 or more elements** (**different**) **chemically bonded** together

<aside> ⚛️ Sodium chloride is a lot of sodium ions attracted to chloride ions, which are attracted to sodium ions. This forms NaCl as a lattice (Note: lattice only refers to ionic compounds), as these ions occur in an equal ratio.

</aside>

-   Molecules: Elements bonded **covalently.** A particle containing two or more atoms joined together by covalent bonds. - has to involve non-metals.
	- **Atom:** Smallest particle of an element that can exist on its own. It is made up of subatomic particles that are indivisible.
- **Ion:** An atom or groups of atoms that has become positively or negatively charged by losing or gaining electrons.
    -   Positively charged - cation (+ve) - formed by losing electrons
    -   Negatively charged - anion (-ve) - formed by gaining electrons

> Anions are attracted to cathodes - Michael Faraday

**Mass of conservation: no matter can be created nor destroyed**

**Chemical symbol**

-   Letter of pair of letters used to represent an element
-   Examples, S, Fe

**Chemical formulae:**

-   The molecular formula gives the total number of atoms of each element present in one **molecule**.
-   The empirical formula gives the simples whole number ratio of atoms of each element present in a **compound**
-   Examples - $Na^+Cl^-$ , $CH_2O$
-   Chemical formula includes both molecular and empirical.

**Stoichiometry is a ratio of substances in an equation when they react.**

-   When you balance a formula, you put **stoichiometric coefficients.**
-   It is used in calculations.
-   The relationship between the relative quantities of substances taking part in a chemical reaction.

**Chemical equation:**

-   Shows the reactants taking part in a chemical reaction and the products from the reactants in the correct proportions.
-   Reactants are on the left, and products are on the right.

**Pure substances:**

-   Have a fixed or constant composition
-   Cannot be separated by physical means
-   Have well defined physical properties, e.g.:
    -   **melting point**
    -   **boiling point**
    -   **hardness**
    -   **density**
    -   **colour**
    -   **solubility**
    -   **conductivity**
-   Have constant chemical properties.
-   Elements, molecules and compounds are pure substances

**Mixtures:**

-   contains two or more different substances, in proportions that can vary
-   properties vary with composition, depends on the identity and amounts of constituents/substances
-   properties of individual constituents/substances can be used to separate the mixture

**Homogenous materials:**

-   have uniform composition throughout
-   includes all pure substances (elements and compounds) and some mixtures
-   the only kind of mixture that is homogenous is a solution e.g. salt water

**Heterogenous materials:**

-   heterogenous materials are non-uniform - you can see differences from one section to another
-   the constituents are physically separated, e.g. in a different phase
-   Examples include:
    -   Granite (mixtures of different mineral grains)
    -   Milk (fat globules suspended in water)
    -   Toothpaste (solid particles suspended in liquid)

**Solution:**

-   Where a minor component (the solute) is uniformly distributed within a major component which is usually a liquid (the solvent)

**3 States of matter:**

-   Solid - molecules are closely bonded together, usually in firm chemical structures. Low kinetic energy - has fixed volume
-   Liquid - molecules are loosely bonded together, there are some small chemical bonds, flows freely and is not found in firm states. Medium kinetic energy - has fixed volume
-   Gas - weak attraction in molecules, high kinetic energy. Gasses attempt to fill the space of their containment.

**Processes of change:**

-   Gas to liquid - condensation
-   Liquid to gas - evaporation
-   Solid to liquid - melting
-   Liquid to solid - freezing/solidification
-   Solid to gas - sublimation
-   Gas to solid - deposition

**Classification of matter:**

Note - mixtures can be separated into pure substances using differences in physical properties.

**Pure substances:**

Note - compounds are separated by chemical means

-   Compounds
-   Elements

**Mixtures:**

-   Homogenous mixtures - you can shine light through a mixture, if it passes through and light does not change, it is homogenous
-   Heterogenous mixtures - if light scatters, it is heterogenous

**Solutions (aq) are mixtures!!! :) thank you ethan widjaja**



notes from ms pilling herself

**1.b Mixtures:**

NOTE: All mixtures are physically mixed together, so they can be separated using physical properties.

Definition of a few key things:

-   Atom - the smallest particle of an element that can exist. It is made up of subatomic particles which are not indivisible (in chemistry)
-   Molecule - (A particle with ) two or more atoms **covalently** bonded together.
-   Element - The **simplest** kind of substance that cannot be broken down into anything else, comprised of atoms with the same number of **protons**.
-   Compound - two or more **elements** (THEY HAVE TO BE DIFFERENT!) chemically bonded together.
-   Mixture - two or more substances that are not chemically bonded together, in varying proportions
    -   Properties vary with composition, depends on the identity/amounts of constituents
    -   Properties of individual constituents can be used to separate these constituents from a mixture.
    -   **KEYWORD: Constituents**
-   Pure - only present in a fixed composition
    -   Elements, compounds, molecules fit this description - some mixtures are pure, e.g. solutions
        
    -   Cannot be separated using physical means
        
    -   Physical properties are **well-defined:**

    -   Chemical properties are consistent
        
-   Impure - contains a non-uniform mixture of substances that are not chemically bonded together.
-   Homogenous - **uniform** composition
    -   called it

-   Heterogenous - **non-uniform** composition
    -   Constituents of heterogenous substances can be separated using physical means
    -   Heterogenous substances are mixtures!!!
