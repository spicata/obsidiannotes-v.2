The Haber process is an epic process discovered by my favourite German Fritz Haber (not endorsing the bad things Haber did). 

Previous to Haber's discovery, it was theorised that Ammonia could be synthesised via a reaction between Nitrogen and Hydrogen gas:

$N_{2(g)} + 3H_{2(g)} \to 2NH_{3(l)}$

However, due to the high activation energy of this reaction, there were no widely available processes to synthesise Ammonia. (Frank-Caro and Birkeland-Eyde were inefficient)

Haber used a Magnetite ($Fe_{3}O_{4}$) catalyst to significantly reduce the activation energy, allowing the reaction to occur under reasonable conditions.

a) Christian Choe Enterprises wants to produce fertilizer for their tomato plants. Their partner company uses a Nickel catalyst to react 12L of Hydrogen gas with excess Nitrogen gas. Under correct conditions, what is the maximum amount of Ammonia gas that can be produced, in moles? (2 marks)

*1 mark, used wrong formula and mole calculation was rough, but working out is correct.*

b) Upon condensing the products of this reaction, workers of the partner company found that the amount of Ammonia produced was less than predicted. Give a reason as to why this is the case. (2 marks)

*0 marks, binding energy does not apply in chemistry. The required answers was something along the lines of the gas not at STP, or equilibrium, or any SIS-related answer.*

c) What is a catalyst, and how is it used in industrial processes? (3 marks)

*1 mark for catalyst def. 1 mark for usages, explanation was shaky and inaccurate at times (average ms Holland marking moment)*

Henry Bui is feeling sad today, and considers using Phosphoric acid. He finds that he needs 6 moles of Protons ($H^{+}$) to do what he wants to do.

$H_{3}PO_{4(aq)} \to 3H^{+}_{(aq)} + PO_{4(aq)}^{3-}$

a) Assuming all molecules of phosphoric acid ionise into protons in solution, how many grams of phosphoric acid does Henry need? (2 marks)

*1 mark, did not establish mole ratio*

b) Henry adds the required amount of phosphoric acid into a large container of water. Has the container increased or decreased in pH? (1 mark)

*1 mark*

c) Upon evaluating the good things in life, Henry forgoes his plans and decides to neutralise the container. He adds 200g of Sodium Hydroxide ($NaOH$), which undergoes the following reaction:

$NaOH_{(aq)} + H^{+}_{(aq)} \to Na^{+}_{{(aq)}} + H_{2}O_{(l)}$

Assuming the whole 200g of $NaOH$ reacts, will this be enough to remove all the added Protons ($H^+$)? (4 Marks)

*no marks awarded, this is what should've been done:*
- *convert 200g of NaOH into moles (5.00025001 mol)*
- *$\therefore$ 5.00025001 mol of $H^+$ react (1:1 mole ratio)*
- *remaining $H^+$ = 6 - 5.00025001 = 0.99974999 mol of $H^+$ left*
- ***thus, not all of the protons are removed.***

You, Ethan Widjaja (a "good" chemistry student), sneak into your teacher's room to take a glimpse at your test results. Instead, you find the following on the whiteboard:

**"Functional Group: A formula commonly used for organic compounds to show the arrangements of atoms."**

a) This definition is not correct. Provide the correct definition for a functional group. (1 mark)

*0 marks, not full answer! functional group influences the properties of the molecule they are attached to.*

b) What term is the provided defintion in reference to? (1 mark)

*1 mark awarded, correct answer of structural formula*

Frederick Yap is doing exercises from Lucarelli. He encounters a question asking him to write the name for the substance $AlI_{3}$, and writes **"Aluminium triiodide"**.

a) Give a reason as to why Frederick's answer is incorrect, and provide the correct name. (2 marks)

*just 2 marks. its because AlI_3 is blah blah blah, not aluminium triiodide. what i wanted to indicate was that aluminium triiodide fulfils **covalent** nomenclature, not ionic, which is the nature of AlI_3. but i give botd*

b) Frederick shows this answer to his teacher and gets publically embarrassed. Now Frederick wants to do bad things to the whole class. He considers burning octane with limited oxygen. 

What is the reaction Frederick is thinking of? (1 mark)

*1 mark*

c) The specific (unbalanced) reaction Frederick is considering is as follows:

$C_{8}H_{18(l)} + O_{2(g)} \to CO_{(g)} + H_{2}O_{(l)}$

Balance the equation. (2 marks)

*2 marks*

d) Frederick sets out on his plan by obtaining a litre of gasseous Octane from Christian Choe Enterprises.

Assuming all of the octane undergoes the reaction above, list the name of the reactants produced and in their quantities. (4 marks)

*2 marks. Reactants identified. Had to use knowledge of Volume -> mole (NOTE THAT I STATED GASSEOUS OCTANE, THIS WAS BIG BOI HINT) to find mass/mole of octane and oxygen that reacted.*

e) Frederick's life meets a tragic end when he fails to wear correct PPE, and while he successfully produces $CO$, he succumbs to $CO$ poisoning.

What are the hazards of the reaction above, and what was the risk it posed to Frederick's health? (2 marks)

*distinguish between hazard vs risk. hazard is the things it can do to you, e.g. its poisonous, deadly, risk is the literally things that may happen to you in relation, e.g. you inhale the CO, CO is absorbed by your blood stream, your organs fail, etc. you get 1 mark for identifying a risk.*

f) The reaction mentioned above is in reference to 2 distinct reactions that can occur under similar conditions. Name all the possible products of the branch of reactions the reaction mentioned above falls under. (3 marks)

*1 mark. complete combustion does not fall under the branch of incomplette combustion, thus you lose a mark. I asked for you to name them, not write a list of reactions. this also cost you a mark.*
