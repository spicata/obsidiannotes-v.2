### Short Answer

1. (7 marks) 
The Haber process is an epic process discovered by my favourite German Fritz Haber (not endorsing the bad things Haber did). 

Previous to Haber's discovery, it was theorised that Ammonia could be synthesised via a reaction between Nitrogen and Hydrogen gas:
$N_{2(g)} + 3H_{2(g)} \to 2NH_{3(l)}$

However, due to the high activation energy of this reaction, there were no widely available processes to synthesise Ammonia. (Frank-Caro and Birkeland-Eyde were inefficient)

Haber used a Magnetite ($Fe_{3}O_{4}$) catalyst to significantly reduce the activation energy, allowing the reaction to occur under reasonable conditions.

a) Christian Choe Enterprises wants to produce fertilizer for their tomato plants. Their partner company uses a Nickel catalyst to react 12L of Hydrogen gas with excess Nitrogen gas. Under correct conditions, what is the maximum amount of Ammonia gas that can be produced, in moles? (2 marks)

b) Upon condensing the products of this reaction, workers of the partner company found that the amount of Ammonia produced was less than predicted. Give a reason as to why this is the case. (2 marks)

c) What is a catalyst, and how is it used in industrial processes? (3 marks)

Vladimir Markovnikov was a Russian chemist, notable for the Markovnikov rule, allowing one to determine the major product of addition reactions.

Chemistry students studying precipitate reactions ad 365 grams of Barium Chloride into an aqueous solution of Sulfuric acid.

a) Give the chemical formula of the precipitate produced. (1 mark)

b) How many grams of precipitate is produced? (3 marks)

4. (7 marks)
Henry Bui is feeling sad today, and considers using Phosphoric acid. He finds that he needs 6 moles of Protons ($H^{+}$) to do what he wants to do.
$H_{3}PO_{4(aq)} \to 3H^{+}_{(aq)} + PO_{4(aq)}^{3-}$

a) Assuming all molecules of phosphoric acid ionise into protons in solution, how many grams of phosphoric acid does Henry need? (2 marks)

b) Henry adds the required amount of phosphoric acid into a large container of water. Has the container increased or decreased in pH? (1 mark)

c) Upon evaluating the good things in life, Henry forgoes his plans and decides to neutralise the container. He adds 200g of Sodium Hydroxide ($NaOH$), which undergoes the following reaction:
$NaOH_{(aq)} + H^{+}_{(aq)} \to Na^{+}_{{(aq)}} + H_{2}O_{(l)}$

Assuming the whole 200g of $NaOH$ reacts, will this be enough to remove all the added Protons ($H^+$)? (4 Marks)

5. (2 marks)
You, Ethan Widjaja (a "good" chemistry student), sneak into your teacher's room to take a glimpse at your test results. Instead, you find the following on the whiteboard:

**"Functional Group: A formula commonly used for organic compounds to show the arrangements of atoms."**

a) This definition is not correct. Provide the correct definition for a functional group. (1 mark)

b) What term is the provided defintion in reference to? (1 mark)
