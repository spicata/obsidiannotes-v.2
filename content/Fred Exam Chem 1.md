The Haber process is an epic process discovered by my favourite German Fritz Haber (not endorsing the bad things Haber did). 

Previous to Haber's discovery, it was theorised that Ammonia could be synthesised via a reaction between Nitrogen and Hydrogen gas:

$N_{2(g)} + 3H_{2(g)} \to 2NH_{3(l)}$

However, due to the high activation energy of this reaction, there were no widely available processes to synthesise Ammonia. (Frank-Caro and Birkeland-Eyde were inefficient)

Haber used a Magnetite ($Fe_{3}O_{4}$) catalyst to significantly reduce the activation energy, allowing the reaction to occur under reasonable conditions.

a) Christian Choe Enterprises wants to produce fertilizer for their tomato plants. Their partner company uses a Nickel catalyst to react 12L of Hydrogen gas with excess Nitrogen gas. Under correct conditions, what is the maximum amount of Ammonia gas that can be produced, in moles? (2 marks)
