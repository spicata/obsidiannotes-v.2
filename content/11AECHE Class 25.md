**Empirical formula:** Simplest whole number ratio of atoms (of each element) in a compound/molecule

**Molecular formula:** Definite ratio, shows all atoms in a molecule

**Hydrated salts:** 

Hydrated salts are anhydrous ionic salts with a certain number of water molecules.

e.g. $CuSO_4.5H_2O$

This gives the molar ratio thank you ethan widjaja :)

The attraction between the salt and water (ion-dipole) is relatively weak, thus if we heat the substance, we can separate the substances into the salt and water
                                heat
e.g. $CuSO_4.5H_{2}O \rightarrow CuSO_{4}+ 5H_2O$

> [!NOTE]
> The heat is meant to be on top of the arrow.
