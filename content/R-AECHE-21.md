**VSEPR:** 
* The four pairs of electrons around a central atom repel each other.
* Pairs of electron arrange themselves so they are as far apart as possible.
* The repulsion between lone pairs is greater than the repulsion between bonding pairs.''

**Allotropes of Carbon**:
* Carbon forms networks of covalent bonds.
* The manner in which these networks forms can affect physical properties.
* e.g. Diamond vs Graphite

Diamond:
* Chemical symbol: $C_{(s)}$
* Bonding: Covalent
* Structure: Molecular network (atoms bonded together)
* Shape: Tetrahedral, bond angle 109.5 degrees
* Conductivity: Very weak, no charged particles (no lone pairs, all electrons are bonded in a shared pair of electrons)

Graphite:
* Chemical symbol: $C_{(s)}$
* Bonding: Covalent
* Structure: Molecular network (atoms bonded together)
* ==Carbon only bonds with **3** carbons, and a delocalised electron is produced.==
* Shape: Triangular planar, bond angle 120 degrees, ==layers==
	* These layers attract each other via **weak** electrostatic forces of attraction, known as **weak dispersion forces**.
* Conductivity: Slightly conductive, there is a mobile charged particle.
