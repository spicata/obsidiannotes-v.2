* p-block elements gain one or more electrons to form stable anions.
* An ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions.
* Millions of anions and cations pack together in a giant ionic lattice.
* **Ionic bonding**: **strong** electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged **ions**(not atoms, not molecules) in a network.

**Melting Point/Boiling point**:
* **Very strong** forces of attraction, therefore **a lot of heat is required** to separate ions.
* IF you were to separate an ionic substance, you would need to break all the individual electrostatic bonds.
* However, they are very weak against force.
* The lattice simply shatters.

**Properties of Ionic compounds**:
* Usually have high melting points.
* Are often soluble in water, but there are exceptions (AgCl, BaSO4 etc.).
* Always conduct electricity when melted or dissolved in water.


**Solubility**:
* Water is a universal solvent.
* It can only dissolve **polar** substances, and water itself is polar.
* **ION DIPOLE ATTRACTION**
