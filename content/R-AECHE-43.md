**Enthalpy** - **thermal energy at constant pressure**

*Chemical reactions:*
reactant $\rightarrow$ products
1. Reactants: breaking bonds
2. Products: forming bonds

Energy is **needed** to overcome **electrostatic force of attraction** and break bonds.

Energy is **released** when bonds are formed.

> [!NOTE]
> *Enthalpy:* the total energy of a substance, including the energy stored in chemical bonds (**chemical potential energy**), and the energy of the substances motion(**kinetic energy**)


The bonds that are broken and formed and the particles that contain them are called the **system**. Essentially, its the **products and the reactants**.
**Surroundings** are the things that are not involved in the reaction, but contain the system.

e.g. if a reaction happens inside an **aqueous solution** the **surroundings** is the **water**.

2 Options:
- System can lose heat, as the bonds that are formed are stronger than the bonds that are broken. More energy is produced, taken from the system into the surroundings.
  System can gain heat, as the bonds that are formed are weaker than the bonds that are broken. Less energy is produced than consumed, which is taken from the surroundings into the system.

**Enthalpy profile diagrams**:
- x axis: **progress of reaction**
- y axis: **Enthalpy (H)**

*Enthalpy change units*: $kJmol^{-1}$

Exothermic reactions:
- **any combustion reactions**

If temperature of surroundings increases, then **enthalpy of system** has decreased.

Thus, *enthalpy of products is less than enthalpy of reactants*, there is a *negative* enthalpy change.

Likewise, if the temperature of surroundings decreases, this is a positive enthalpy change (endo).

Endothermic reactions:
- Photosynthesis (reverse combustion)
