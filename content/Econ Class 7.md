In Socialist economy, the government **provides("owns") *certain* factors of production that are required,** where the free market takes care of the rest.

## Schools of Thought
### Classical Economics
- Classical economic theory was made by Adam Smith
- Advocates for **no** government intervention in the market place
- **Wants** the market to sort any economic issues out
- **Wants** free trade.
	- Saw whole planet as 1 big market. 
- Adam was "anti-communist"? 
- Coincided with the industrial revolution
- Many fundamental economic theories such as supply and demand were a product of classical economics.
	- Believed supply and demand and the price mechanism will fix the market
- Prior to the rise of classical economics, most economies **were under the control of some type of monarch.**
- Under these systems, the economy was tightly controlled by the state.
- If the King (or Queen) decides to raise your taxes, there is no one you can complain to
- **Classical economics is the opposite of *"command and control"* systems and became associated with freedom.**
- Feudal system was kinda communist??? There was no private entity.
- As feudal systems lose power, it seemed natural economics would be more free.
- **The Invisible Hand:** metaphor for demand and supply, the **forces that move the free market**.
	- Individuals work in self interest, and are selfish. However, as everyone works to improve themselves, everyone becomes richer and thus society becomes richer.
- The constant change of pressures on supply and demand create natural movement of prices and the flow of trade.
- **Laissez-faire**, meaning let it go, in an approach to the market.
- It believes the **market will find equilibrium**, however, this is untrue, as market always moves towards equilibrium due to there always being a present force for change.
	- Equilibrium can be high or low, 
Main Classical Economists:
- Adam Smith - wealth of nations
- David Ricardo - free trade, **comparative advantage**
- Karl Marx - Worried about the worker being abused by the capitalists, is at the end of the classical economist, because he was in the period. However, he perceived a weakness of the classical economics school.
### Keynesian Economics
- A school of economic thought founded by john Maynard Keynes and developed by his followers.
- Believed consumers should spend money.
- He placed emphasis from the study of the economic behaviour of individuals and companies to the study of the behaviour of the economy as a whole - i.e. self interest on individual not important.
- The main idea is that **aggregate demand (total)** is created by household, business, *and government*.
- *Dynamics* of **free market** is NOT the main force of an economy.
	- The nazi's created infrastructure, and helped Germany come out of the great depression early.
	- This is an example of government interference.
- Said that **free markets have no self balancing mechanism**, and **government must interfere**.
- **Government interference should be through public policies to achieve full employment and price stability**.
- During recession, more spending, during boom less spending.
- *Employment stimulates aggregate demand*
- Keynesian explores when the **macroeconomy** is in recession, or  **disequilibrium**. 

"He advocates interference in the market, more or less government spending depending on circumstances"

### Supply side Economics
- Theory that income taxes reduce incentives for *work, savings, and investment,* and that accelerated **economic growth** without **inflation** can be achieved by increasing the supply of goods and services
	- If taxes are cut, individuals will be incentivised to work hard, earn more money, and invest
	- Cut business taxes will lead to employment, investment, etc.
	- There will be no inflation due to investment
- Supply side economics advocates large scale **tax cuts**, for individuals and corporation, and *deregulation of business (they can do anything they want, as it will benefit economy)* and **strong incentives for investment**.
- This doesn't usually works, as 75% of tax cuts received by corps were not invested (donald trump tax cuts). The following happened:
	- Gave bonuses
	- Share buy schemes? They buy shares, so owners get profits
- On individual level, tax cuts had no real impact, as they weren't paying any tax anyways.
	- Their spending didn't change, and their savings didn't improve
- **Theory that says increased production drives economic growth**.
- **Factors of production:** Capital, labour, entrepreneurship and land.
- Focuses on businesses and firms. Create jobs, people will go and spend, people will help economic growth, and more jobs will be created. 
- Examples:
	- Reaganomics
	- Bush Tax Cuts
	- Trump Tax Cuts
- Economist associated with supply side:
	- Robert Mundell
	- Arthur Laffer
	- Herbert Stein

**Keynesian vs Supply side**
- Keynesian is driven by **aggregate demand**. When demand increases, factories will produce stuff for demand
- Supply side says producing things first will lead to people buying it.

### Monetarism
- Monetarism is an economic theory that regards the **money supply** as the most important **driver of economic growth**. - supply of money is the most important driver of growth???
	- For Classical, its about market, for Keynes, its about aggregate demand, for supply, its about aggregate supply, for monetarism, its about how much **money is in circulation**. People with more money will spend it, and create **high economic growth**.
- If you increase the money supply abut x% per year, you will get x% economic growth.
- As money supply grows, people demand more goods,  and factories will produce more, creating new jobs and furthering economic growth. 
- Increase money supply at *exact percentage* to prevent inflationary pressures.
- **Central banks** play a role in monetary pressures as they *control the money supply*. 
- When the money supply increases, the cost of money increases. This leads to more borrowing, lower interest rates, they will spend, and this *increases economic growth*.
- Interest rates are the **cost of money**.
- More money out there, cost goes down. 
Economists:
- Milton Friedman
- Alan Greenspan
