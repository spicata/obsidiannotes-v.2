## Living Standards

- The living standard of a population is **measured** in two ways: **material living standards and non-material living standards.**
- Material Standards **measures quality and quantity of goods and services** for each person in an economy
	- We have to consider the **availability** of goods and services (are they accessible?)
	- Measured by **real GDP**. *GDP measures the stuff we've got.*
	- Material living standards refer to our access to physical goods and services.
	- The car we drive, the house we live in and the food we eat are all examples of physical possessions that contribute to our material living standards.
	- The material living standards of a nation are usually accessed or measured by the quantity of goods and services available each year as measured by , for example, GDP.
	- Many would agree that if the citizens of a country have access to more goods and services to satisfy their needs and wants, life is generally better.
	- Moreover, producing goods and services provides citizens with employment, and therefore an income to buy goods and services that improve their lives.
- Non-material Standards measure **intangibles**, focusing on **quality of life**
	- The dimensions measured are usually life expectancy, literacy, rate, leisure hours, etc.
	- Non-material living standards must also be considered when assessing the quality of life.
	- Non-material living standards cannot be measured in dollar terms, and are intangible, but affect our enjoyment of life.
	- Non-material living standards are **hard to measure**.
		- We have some indicators, however, such as the OECD Better Life Index.

### Examples of Material standards of living
- Income
- Housing
- Access to amenities
	- Public transport
	- Water
	- Electricity

### Examples of Non-material standards of living
- Environment
- Leisure time
- Work life balance
- Political freedoms

#### More factors:
- **Freedom of speech** - such as being able to peacefully protest against the government of the day
- **Free elections** - that provide the right to choose and dismiss parliamentary representatives
- **Low levels of crime and discrimination** - where citizens can live without fear of constant crime or being treated differently because off actors such as race, disability or age.
- ***Preservation of the environment*** - allowing citizens to enjoy nature, breathe clean air and drink clean water
- **Adequate leisure time** - so that employment have adequate rest periods away from work and time to spend with family

### Effect of living standards in the real world:
- China has focused primarily on the material standard of living when progressing their economy.

### Important questions about living standards:
- What happens when basic living standards are not met?
- What are basic needs that would ensure an acceptable standard of living for an individual in society?
- What are some benchmarks that allow us to ascertain if living standards are met
- Are material needs more important than non-material needs?

## Poverty
- Poverty can be defined as the state in which an individual or household is not able to fulfil minimum consumption needs.
- It is not always about money, but it also entails access to basic facilities such as proper hygiene, sanitation, food, shelter, drinking water, health, education, transport, whose absence as a whole, is regarded as poverty.
- It can be absolute poverty or relative poverty. Absolute poverty is when there is an absence of a minimum level of subsistence needed for the basic well being.

### Absolute poverty
- Cannot meet the basic necessities of life
	- Sanitation, medical care, education, food
- We compare the income of a household with the standard minimum income of the household within an economy.
- This standard is different depending on the country.

### Relative poverty
- Someone who lacks the least amount of income required to maintain the normal standard of living, in the society to which they belong.
	- For example they may not have access to housing
- They are **relatively poor** compared to other members of society.
- The word relative means in comparison to, so we define poverty concern the **overall distribution of income** to another person/family/country.
- We either compare members of a country, or we compare **countries with countries**.

### Housing
- Housing is fundamental to all Australians and our housing market has a significant influence on a number of key social and economic aspects of society.
- It plays a major role in the health and wellbeing of Australians, by providing shelter, safety, security and privacy.
- The availability of affordable, sustainable and appropriate housing enables people to participate in the social, economic and community aspects of their lives.
- From a social perspective, housing provides a stable base from which we can participate in society, form families, and enjoy retirement. Housing can determine lifetime education, employment and health outcomes.
- From an economic perspective, housing has a significant impact upon investment, productivity and participation, as well as consumption and saving trends across the economy.
#### Housing security
- What happens when our society cannot maintain affordable housing?
- A lot of bad consequences.
- The absence of affordable, secure and appropriate housing can result in homelessness, poor health and lower rates of employment and education.

#### Homelessness
- People experiencing homelessness include those who sleep rough on the streets or under **makeshift** dwellings.
- Although people who sleep rough are most visible to the public, they only represent 7% of homelessness in Australia.
- Homelessness can also include individuals and families moving between temporary shelters, including housing of friends, family and emergency acommodation.
- The legal definition is different for every country.
- People who are homeless are most often unable to acquire and maintain regular, safe, secure and adequate housing due to an unsteady or lack of income.
- Homelessness and **poverty** are **interrelated**.
	- *It is difficult to get a job, if you lack a stable environment to apply for jobs.*
- In general, there is no methodological consent on counting the homeless and identifying their special needs, thus in most cities only estimated homeless populations are know.

### The poverty line
- Poverty line is often discussed in relation to poverty, which means an estimated minimum household income threshold, which is required to fulfil the basic necessities of life.
- Any person or family below this threshold is identified as poor.

### What is income:
- Income is money that an individual or business receives, usually from exchanging by providing a good or service through investing capital.
- Investments, pensions, and forms of welfare payment are primary sources of income for retirees.
- For individuals, income is most often received in the form of wages or salary.
- Business income can refer to a company's remaining revenues after paying all expenses and taxes. In this case, income is referred to as "earnings". Most forms of income are subject to taxation

What affects income?
- Personal incomes:
	- Economic/social/political conditions
	- Education
	- Experience
	- etc.
- Business incomes:
	- Economic climate
	- Factors of Production cost?

## Lesson Tasks:
- Look at different types of housing in Australia, and find how much is available (private, rental, public)
