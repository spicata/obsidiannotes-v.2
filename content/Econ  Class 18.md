## Living Standards

- The living standard of a population is **measured** in two ways: **material living standards and non-material living standards.**
- Material Standards **measures quality and quantity of goods and services** for each person in an economy
	- We have to consider the **availability** of goods and services (are they accessible?)
	- Measured by **real GDP**. *GDP measures the stuff we've got.*
- Non-material Standards measure **intangibles**, focusing on **quality of life**
	- The dimensions measured are usually life expectancy, literacy, rate, leisure hours, etc.

### Examples of Material standards of living
- Income
- Housing
- Access to amenities

### Examples of Non-material standards of living
