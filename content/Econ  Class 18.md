## Living Standards

- The living standard of a population is **measured** in two ways: **material living standards and non-material living standards.**
- Material Standards **measures quality and quantity of goods and services** for each person in an economy
	- We have to consider the **availability** of goods and services (are they accessible?)
	- Measured by **real GDP**. *GDP measures the stuff we've got.*
	- Material living standards refer to our access to physical goods and services.
	- The car we drive, the house we live in and the food we eat are all examples of physical possessions that contribute to our material living standards.
	- The material living standards of a nation are usually accessed or measured by the quantity of goods and services available each year as measured by , for example, GDP.
	- Many would agree that if the citizens of a countr yahve access to more goods and services to satisfy their needs and wants, life is generally better.
	- Moreover, producing goods and services provides citizens with employment, and therefore an income to buy goods and services that imrpove their lives.
- Non-material Standards measure **intangibles**, focusing on **quality of life**
	- The dimensions measured are usually life expectancy, literacy, rate, leisure hours, etc.
	- Non-material living standards must also be considered when assessing the quality of life.
	- Non-material living standards cannot be measured in dollar terms, and are intangible, but affect our enjoyment of life.
	- Non-material living standards are **hard to measure**.
		- We have some indicators, however, such as the OECD Better Life Index.

### Examples of Material standards of living
- Income
- Housing
- Access to amenities
	- Public transport
	- Water
	- Electricity

### Examples of Non-material standards of living
- Environment
- Leisure time
- Work life balance
- Political freedoms

#### More factors:
- **Freedom of speech** - such as being able to peacefully protest against the government of the day
- **Free elections** - that provide the right to choose and dismiss parliamentary representatives
- **Low levels of crime and discrimination** - where citizens can live without fear of constant crime or being treated differently because off actors such as race, disability or age.
- ***Preservation of the environment*** - allowing citizens to enjoy nature, breathe clean air and drink clean water
- **Adequate leisure time** - so that employment have adequate rest periods away from work and time to spend with family

### Effect of living standards in the real world:
- China has focused primarily on the material standard of living when progressing their economy.

### Important questions about living standards:
- What happens when basic living standards are not met?
- What are basic needs that would ensure an acceptable standard of living for an individual in society?
- What are some benchmarks that allow us to ascertain if living standards are met
- Are material needs more important than non-material needs?
