## Corrosion of Metals
- The degradation of metals due to an *electrochemical* process.
	- Actually refers to **iron**.
- Influences on corrosion:
	- Impurities
		- Can either protect iron or enhance rate of corrosion.
	- Air and moisture
	- Prescence of electrolytes
		- Sea water
		- Strains in metal
		- Dents
		- Scratches
- Types of corrosion:
	- Dry/Chemical corrosion
		- Reaction of metals with **gasses in atmosphere**
		- Typically reaction with oxygen.
		- e.g. $2Mg_{(s)} + O_{2(g)} \to 2MgO_{(s)}$
		- Not nitrogen!!!!! Ea is too high to break through triple bond.
		- Molecules with low activation energy tend to be viable for chemical corrosion
			- $O_2, SO_2, CO_2, H_2S$
	- Wet/Electrochemical corrosion
		- Requires presence of water, producing microscopic galvanic cell.
		- It occurs due to setting up of a large number of tiny galvanic cells in metal in prescence of impurity as well as in prescence of moisture
		- e.g rusting of iron in moist atomsphere
