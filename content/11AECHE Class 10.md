**Atomic Spectra**

Bohr’s model helped describe the spectra of hydrogen.

It showed 4 lines of absorption.

What does spectra represent?

It represents different wavelengths which correlate to different colours.

NOTE: Electrons occupy **fixed** **energy levels**.

The lines are energy levels.

Lines inside absorption/emissions spectrum are called spectra.

Absorption spectrum: **Black lines on coloured spectrum**
Emissions spectrum: **Coloured lines on black spectrum**

n = 1 → n = 2 does not exist in visible light. (infared)

Balmer series refers to the possible promotions of electrons that produce visible light.

Balmer goes from **n = 2** to whatever the largest electron shell is.

* Lyman series produces UV light
* Paschen series produces infared light

**Particle Theory of Light**

First proposed by Einstein, he called them photons.

Energy of photon related to frequency of light wave by the Planck constant

In essence, light acts as both a wave and a particle, the wave part being described by Schrodinger's equation when excited electrons return to their ground state.

Things that excite electrons:

-   Light
-   Electrical current
-   Heat
-   Bombarding it with electrons? (kinetic energy)

Each atom has a particular pattern for absorption and emissions

Some methods aren’t good, they don’t give enough energy or energy at the exact magnitude/wavelength to excite an electron.

Electrons can absorb energy, and become excited (promoted to a higher energy state) by:

-   Heat
-   Electrical discharge
-   Electromagnetic radiation (photons)

Then they emit energy as electromagnetic radiation, and return to their ground state.

They will always emit the same amount of energy as they absorb.

Balmer series = promotion from n = 2 to other energy levels, which absorb/emit visible light.

Bohr’s Model of the Atom:

-   Electrons exist in discrete energy levels - they cannot have intermediate energies.
-   A photon can be emitted or absorbed when an electron moves between energy levels.
-   The energy of the photon corresponds to the difference between energy levels ($\Delta E$)
-   Frequency of photons found by $\Delta E = hv$

Continuous spectrum (white light) vs Emissions spectrum vs Absorption spectrum.

Continuous spectrum is what you see when you use a spectroscope on white light.

How to get continuous spectrum? Iridescent light (source of white light), which does through diffraction grating to create a continuous spectrum

Heating up gas creates an emission spectrum. - heating up gas will give electrons energy,

Lighting white light through cold gas will create an absorption spectrum.

Absorption spectra:

-   Atom absorbs a photon, electron promoted to higher energy state
-   Continuous spectrum of light has a specific frequencies of light missing - black lines on a continuous spectrum

**Atomic absorption spectroscopy**: - more detail

-   Analyses absorption spectra
-   Sample of substance is vaporised, light of specific frequencies shone through it (from a hollow cathode lamp of same element being tested for), atoms absorb photons as electrons are promoted, remaining light has frequencies missing.
-   Specific frequencies missing identify the element. Intensity of absorptions gives concentration of metal in sample.
-   Useful for identifying metals in water, biological tissue, mineral samples, etc.

Emission spectra:

-   Atom becomes excited, electrons are already in higher energy levels.
-   Electron drops down to lower energy level.
-   Only specific frequencies of light are emitted - coloured lines on a black background.

Plank discovered that Light energy is quantised.

Einstein discovered that light waves have the properties of a particle.
