#### A good method:
-   **Is a numbered list of instructions, not a description or explanation.**
-   **Makes clear the order in which things happen.**
-   **States what equipment is used at each stage**
-   **Gives quantities where required.**
-   **Makes sense to another human!**


i still dont know how to write a good method
