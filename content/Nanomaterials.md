# Nanomaterials


Pearson:

**1.2 Nanotechnology:**

-   **Nanotechnology:** A branch of materials science that investigates the design properties and applications of materials produced on this scale.
    -   Nano - Particles larger than individual atoms, but smaller than the wavelength of light, thus cannot be viewed through optical microscopes
-   Nanoscale: structures that are between 1 - 100 nanometers across.
    -   Nanometer (nm): $10^{-9}$ m wide
-   **Nanomaterials:** substances that can be both natural and synthetic, that are composed of single units that exist in the nanoscale.
-   **Family of carbon molecules called fullerenes!!**
    -   3 dimensional structures formed by networks of carbon
    -   Most prominent one is one that forms a cylindrical tube called **carbon nanotube**
        -   Formed from a flat, 2-dimension layer of carbon atoms arranged in hexagons, known as graphene.
    -   Carbon nanotubes are really strong and stiff
-   **Top-down fabrication:**
    -   Starts with material of a larger scale than desire, which is selectively removed or the size of the material is progressively reduced, by grinding, until the required size and shape is achieved.
    -   Most commonly used technique for manufacturing
    -   **Advantages:**
        -   Large quantities of material can be produced
        -   Very cheap
        -   Decent uniformity
    -   **Disadvantages:**
        -   Limited to simplicity
        -   Limited to scale of tools (how precise can it be?)
-   **Bottom-up fabrication:**
    -   Physically growing, or building, materials atom by atom/molecule by molecule.
    -   Like chemical syntheses, but on a nanoscale.
    -   ‘Self-assembling’ nanomaterials?
-   **Nanoparticles:**
    -   A specific type of nanomaterials, usually spherical particles with diameters of about 1-100 nm.
    -   In this size range, **properties** start to change. e.g. Gold is usually golden, but in nanoparticles it can take numerous colours.
-   Normally sunscreens contain metal oxides, however when zinc nanoparticles are used, they interact with light differently and appear clear.
-   **Colloids:**
    -   A mixture where one insoluble substance is dispersed in another. Colloids contain particles on the nanoscale that do not settle out of the mixture over time.
    -   A homogeneous non-crystalline substance consisting of large molecules or ultramicroscopic particles of one substance dispersed through a second substance

**4.4 Metallic Nanomaterials:**

-   Consist of metal ions arranged to make structures that have **at least 1 dimension** in in the nanometre scale (1 - 100 nm)

8.9: Fullerenes:

-   A recently discovered allotropic form of carbon.
-   A new group of fullerenes, Carbon Nanotubes was discovered in Japan.
-   **Fullerenes:** Three-dimensional structures formed by networks of carbon atoms.
-   Visualise carbon nanotubes as a graphene sheet rolled into a cylinder shape.
    -   Ends of CNTs are usually open or capped off using a hemispherical arrangement of carbon atoms bonded into interlocking pentagon and hexagon arrangements.
    -   CNTs are $1\times10^{-9}$m or 1 nanometre wide by diameter, but can be as long as several micrometres - a thousandth of a millimeter, $1 \times 10^{-6}$.
    -   CNTs can have an unlimited length, and can be produced with multiple walls with multiple concentric CNTs with increasing diameter being fit into one another. (**Multi Walled Nanotubes (MWNTs)**)
    -   Atoms in CNTs are bonded through covalent bonds, giving CNTs a lot of strength/flexibility.
    -   They are also very light as they are comprised of carbon. This creates a super-strong lightweight material.
    -   CNTs also have weird electrical properties.
        -   Used as semiconductors/conductors.
        -   Can conduct 1000 times better than copper and silver.
        -   They can conduct with little to no heating effect (radiation emitted?)
        -   This means CNTs have a lot of potential for electrical devises.
-   Fullerenes have a lot of surface area, and can be molecular containers. They also bond to surfaces and other structures really well.
-   Thus, they have many applications
-   **Nanotechnology:** A new field of scientific endeavour focused on the study and potential application of fullerenes, nanoparticles and other similar structures.

8.10 Nanotechnology:

-   **Nanoparticles:** Particles with at least one dimension in the 1-100 nanometre range.
-   Nanoparticles have **unique properties** due to **quantum effects,** as a result of a **small particle size**.
-   For example, Zinc and Titanium oxide are commonly used in sunscreen and cosmetics.
    -   In general, they are used as **“macro particles”**. This means small particles but larger than nanoparticles.
        -   This makes a visible white opaque layer!
    -   Instead, using $ZnO$ and $TiO_2$ as nanoparticles allows for a **quantum effect**, as they become **invisible** while still absorbing UV.
-   **In general,** these **quantum effects** greatly impact **optical properties.**
    -   This is because nanoparticles, with their quantum effects, interact differently with light.
-   However, differently sized nanoparticles also can produce unique properties.
-   For example, Cadmium Selenide as a nanoparticle will produce different visible light when UV light is shone onto a solution containing them.
-   These particles are known as “**quantum dots**”.
    -   (They affect the wavelength of light, with smaller dots producing shorter wavelengths and vice versa.)
-   CNTs also have electrical properties that differ from Carbon’s.
-   These electrical properties make it a really good conductor and semiconductor, allowing computers to be compacted further as semiconductors are built within a nanometre’s range.
-   Silver has many antibacterial and antifungal effects, which is further enhanced when used in **nanoparticle form.**
    -   This is due to an increase in surface area, a common property of fullerenes.
-   **Nanodevice research!!!** - uses in medical field, e.g. for diagnosis/detection/treatment of cancer
-   **Dendrimers** - nanosized nanoparticle structures
-   They can be designed as molecular carriers, which can carry molecules that recognise cancer, kill cancers, recognise a dead cancer cell, signal a cancer cell’s death, etc.
-   Using dendrimers in this fashion, one can kill cancer cells, while reporting its efficiency.
    -   NOTE: This would mean literally no side effects, as its only killing cancer (the bad stuff) and doesn’t work like radiation which also kills healthy cells (the good stuff)
-   These devices are called **therapeutic nanodevices**, and use **quantum dots, nanoshells and nanopores**.

8.11 Nanocomposites.

-   Nanoparticles have been around for a long time, despite nanotechnology being very new.
-   Carbon black(soot), an amorphous form of carbon is largely comprised of carbon particles in the nanometre range.
    -   Used as an additive in rubber for tyres, as its really strong. Tyres have 25% of its rubber made of carbon black.
    -   More amounts of carbon black will make the rubber more conductive, preventing build-ups of static electricity. - useful to prevent accidents.
-   **Nanocomposites:** Materials created by adding nanosized particles of one material to a matrix of a bulk material (metal, polymer, ceramics(recall Pearson))
-   Nanocomposites have numerous advantages and more useful properties:
    -   Mechanical strength
    -   Electrical/thermal conductivity
    -   Optical properties
-   Used in manufacturing of plastics - nanotubes or graphene is added.
-   1-5% concentration of nanoparticles in nanocomposites can increase stiffness by 50%, and mechanical strength by 20%
-   They slow down cracks from forming as they have high tensile strength.
-   Can be used in lithium ion batteries - comprised of electrodes, which are usually made of graphite - carbon nanotubes, graphene sheets and nanocomposites have been suggested as replacements.
    -   Carbon-silicon nanocomposite material seems to be promising
    -   Silicon has good energy storage, but breaks down as it contracts and expands when charges are discharged.
    -   This is where nanoparticles of carbon come in, as they can maintain a rigid structure, while still having the high energy storage of silicon.

**Examples of Nanomaterials:**

-   Carbon
-   Gold
-   Silver
-   Zinc Oxide
-   Cadmium selenide
-   Titanium oxide
-   Amorphous silica ($SiO_2$)
-   Copper
-   Iron

**Advantages of nanomaterials: have been listed above**

**Disadvantages of nanomaterials:**

-   SAFETY CONCERNS:
    -   **important rule: the properties of nanoparticles differ from the parent material in bulk form.**
        -   e.g. glass fibre particles are very harmful, and brick workers use breathing masks to prevent exposure. In contrast, glass in bulk form is inert and harmless.
-   Very hard to make:
    -   **The production of nanomaterials requires a complex design and production infrastructure. There are numerous means to create nanoparticles, however they are usually very expensive and exclusive.**

**WACE Study Guide Review:**
* In general, the properties (physical + chemical) of bulk materials remains constant regardless of size.
* However, as particle size becomes small, then properties can change drastically.

- A nanoparticle is a particle that has at least 1 dimension within the nanoscale (1 - 100 nm (1 nm -> $1 \times 10^{-9}$m)).

- **Nanotechnology**: 
	- As particle size decreases, surface area greatly increases.
	- This means that more atoms/molecules can interact.
	- Reactivity is generally higher in nanoparticles due to their larger surface area, creating unique properties, that are very different in their macro particle form.
	- Light has a wavelength of around 500 nanometres. This means that photons are significantly larger than nanoparticles, which can exist in dimensions as small as 1 nanometre.
		- This means that light simply passes through nanomaterials, and **do not reflect**.
	- This is called a **quantum effect**. Essentially, due to their very small size, nanoparticles interact uniquely with particles of radiation, like light (electromagnetic).
	- Other forms of quantum effects exist. *Cadmium selenide* produces different types of coloured light depending on particle size while being in a solution.
		- This is different to macro particles of *Cadmium selenide*, which is insoluble and does not exhibit this range of colours.
	- Applications of nanotechnology include:
		- Sunscreens
			- Zinc oxide in its macro particle form is an effective absorber of UV light, which is why it is commonly used in sunscreens.
			- However, zinc oxide in its macro particle form is also a white, opaque substance.
			- Zinc oxide as nanoparticles becomes *transparent*, as a result of a unique **quantum effect**.
		- Special surfaces and coatings
		- Nanocomposite materials
		- Medicine
	- However, it is important to be aware of certain safety issues and regulations.
