**Covalent bond:** A shared pair of electrons. There is an electrostatic force of attraction between the bonding pairs of electrons and the nuclei of the atoms at each side.


**Covalent bonding:**
* Discrete molecules: $Cl_2, H_2, CO_2, HCl$
* Network: $C_{(s)}, Si$

**Dispersion forces:** exists between all molecules and arises due to very weak electrostatic attraction between induces and temporary dipoles. e.g. Random motion of electrons creates areas in a molecule that are slightly negative and slightly charged.

**always say relative e.g. water is relatively high considering it is a small molecule**


Ice is less dense than water due to hydrogen bonding

**Lewis Diagrams:**

H_2 has a simple diagram of H-H. There is a single bond between the two because the valency is 1

What makes nitrogen very inert?

Nitrogen gas bonds in triple bonds. Therefore, to make nitrogen do anything, you need to break a relatively strong triple bond.

**NOTE: Pyramidal bond angle is 107 degrees, Triangular planar is 120 degrees. RESEARCH OCTET EXPANSION**
