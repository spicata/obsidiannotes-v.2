title: "27-11-2022 Sleep is not as important"
---

*In response to Christian's message to me and Fred*

# 1. People are different
- I have found that I generally don't need that much sleep to function well. It is most likely as a result of growing up, but I've ever been "tired" for school during Year 7. I still remember Dr Waters calling me out for yawning during his lesson. 
- This is most likely the same for Fred, however I can't exactly speak on his behalf.
- I feel that days where I've had 6 hours of sleep turn out the same as days with 9 hours of sleep
# 2. People adapt to their situations
- It's just been exam week Christian, and I have been cramming. Cramming a lot. Perhaps if I crammed even more, I would've gotten that last stupid comp sci question. Like who tf remembers what interfaces are in Cisco, and what commands you need to set up fg0/0 and fg0/1. Anyways I digress. I have had to adapt to the situation by reducing my sleep.
	- Regardless, I personally feel that my performance is not affected. For example, before the Literature exam I had 6 hours of sleep because I accidentally drank coffee. Despite that, I think I did rather well during the exam, however I will update this page when I have received my marks.
- Fred also must've adapted to his situation, as we both had the same exam period, much like you. 
- In conclusion, because of exam period, we had to decrease sleep. This does not warrant the creation of a page to blatantly call us out.

# 3. "Stop playing Minecraft!!!"
- I have.

# 4. The "deep sleep" argument
- I have a somewhat reliable sleep tracker on my watch. Since I usually average 6 hours of sleep, I tend to check my watch everyday to see how much deep sleep I get. What I find is that it varies from 20m to 1h. 
	- My conclusion from this is that deep sleep has minimal impact of the outcome of the day. These variations have occurred broadly across the past few weeks, and do not seem to have any impact on me other than psychological (placebo effect, feel better with more deep sleep).

# 5. Mood
- To quote the big green guy: "I'm always angry".
	- This is true in some sense. I tend to study as a means of fulfilling some artificial criterion in assessments. While we both have different philosophies on what study should be directed for, I personally believe that the current system of studying for exams is justifiable in some sense. It develops adaptability in students, which is a desirable characteristic of an individual in the workplace.
	- Anyways, what this means is that I am not motivated to study by passion (in general, with exceptions). Instead, I do so because I have commitments and goals I set out for myself, and I want to accomplish this. 
	- As a result, "mood" does not play a factor in this.
- I believe the aforementioned situation is similar for Fred, but once again I cannot speak on his behalf.

# 6. Conclusions
- I'll get better sleep.
- My lack of sleep in recent days does not warrant me and Fred being called out.
- You stayed up to 11pm last night. 

This was an experiment into writing blog-like posts, similar to Christian Choe. ðŸ’–
