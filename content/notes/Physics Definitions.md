# Physics Definitions

**Distance:** The total movement of an object without any regard to direction.
**Displacement:** The change in position of an object.
**Speed:** The time rate at which an object is moving along a path.
**Rate**: A measure over time.
**Acceleration:** A change in speed or velocity. This change can be positive and negative. (the rate at which velocity changes)
**Velocity:** The rate of change in displacement and direction of an object.
**Force:** The push or pull on an object with mass that causes a change in velocity.
**Inertia:** A property of matter by which it continues in its existing state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line, unless that state is changed by an external force.
- Objects continue in their state, either stationary or moving, unless a force acts on them. 
- *The tendency of an object to maintain its current status* (usually velocity)
**Centre of Gravity:** An imaginary point in a body of matter where it can be thought mass is concentrated.
- A balance point of an object.
**Stable Equilibrium:** A state of equilibrium of an object where if the object were displaced it would return to its original position.
**Moment:** A force that causes an object to turn.
**Gravity:** A fundamental force of mutual attraction between objects with mass/energy

**Vector:** A strength or size of force (magnitude) that acts in a *particular direction*.
**Scalar:** A magnitude without direction.

| Vector       | Scalar   |
| ------------ | -------- |
| Displacement | Distance |
| Velocity     | Speed    |
| Acceleration | Time     |
| Force             |          |

**Newton's Laws:**
- 1st Law (of inertia): In general, objects continue to keep on doing what they are already doing.
