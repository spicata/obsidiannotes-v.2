**Host (1):** Hey there! The time is 3.23pm on Thursday, May 11th, 2017 and you're tuning in to the Independent Informers! We are extremely grateful to have guest speaker Hải Minh Nguyễn on our podcast today. His bestseller "A Soulless Ocean" has brought to light the struggles that countless families bravely endured for a chance at a new life in Australia. Hải Minh, what do you think about Dutton's recent budget media release?

(Screen shows a picture of Dutton at a press conference, which fades back into intro screen as **Hải Minh** talks.)

**Hải Minh (1):** It's frankly outrageous. I find it difficult to believe that Australia, one of the strongest democracies in the free world, could implement such an unsympathetic border policy. I can still remember the journey my family took to leave Vietnam. 

(Screen fades into picture of an abandoned home in Saigon)

(2) When the North seized Saigon, they took everything away from us. So we gathered as many valuables we had left, and paid for a boat to Australia. 

(Screen fades to a Vietnamese empty harbour)

(3) For those saying that we took the coward's way out, I assure you this was more punishment than escape. Any family I had back in Vietnam are either dead or lost to me. 

(Storm music, boat images)

(4) The voyage was heartless, with the waves thundering like the artillery shells back at home. It was as if I had never left. The suffocating winds of salt were overcome by the smell of vomit. This was a struggle that everyone onboard experienced, for months on end. Not everyone would make it through. My grandmother would pass away a few kilometres from the shores of Australia.

**Host (2):** Wow. I'm deeply sorry for your loss.

**Hải Minh (5):** She was one of the lucky ones, because she was buried in Australia. Those that died before would be thrown into the sea. Our family went through all this pain and suffering, just to make it to Australia. To have a new life, one free from authority. For them, the risk of dying thousands of kilometres away from home was worth it. 

(Western music plays)

**Host (3):** Truly tragic. I hope you've found peace with her passing. What do you think about the plight of other refugees?

(Picture of refugees show)

**Hải Minh (6):** They just want to survive, and have the best opportunity at life. When we send back boats, we are denying refugees their basic human rights to live free from tyranny. I am fortunate to have had many great moments in my life. But none were as joyous or rewarding when I got off the boat and stepped foot onto an Australian harbour. Having made it through the treacherous journey across the Pacific, I could really appreciate the tranquillity and silence of Australia.

**Host: (4)** How did you and your family adapt to this new environment?

**Hải Minh: (7)** My family had nothing to their name, so we had to work hard to survive. And we did. With a smile on our face, because we knew the alternative was a cold, bitter life as workers under Vietnam's tyrannical government. 

Funny story, my birthday, ten days ago, isn't even my real birthday. Before we fled, the communists even took our birth certificates. My parents didn't know the birthdays of their ten children, so they just gave me one. That's how monstrous the Vietnamese government was to us.

**Host (5):** Wow. I admire you for finding humour in a truly dire situation. What do you remember of your past life?

(Traditional Vietnamese song returns temporarily)

**Hải Minh: (8)** Ah, there are definitely some things I miss from Vietnam. If I focus really hard, I can still recall the times when my whole family would sing to me a traditional Vietnamese song, I only have my mother to sing to me now. Sometimes, when I pass by a Vietnamese restaurant, the smell reminds me of my last meal of phở in Vietnam, before all I would smell for months would be stomach fluid and mildew.

(Western song returns)

**Host (6):** Do you return to the harbour where you first stepped foot in Australia often?

**Hải Minh: (9)** Absolutely. I regularly go back and just sit in the sand with my family. My life in Vietnam ended there, but my life as an Australian began. The restful flow of the waves remind me of my journey, and those I had left behind. Precious memories, falling from my mind and into the ocean like handfuls of sand. I will never forget the first time I grasped the cool, saline seaside, it was the day I became Australian.

**Host (7):** Amazing. 

(End music rolls, back to intro screen)
