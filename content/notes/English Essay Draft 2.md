Question (4): Discuss how particular values and attitudes are **promoted** within at least one studied text to **challenge** an audience.

Individuals in society reflect their own concerns over the direction their community takes. This is most prominent in the literature and artistic works of turbulent time-periods. The short story 'Immersion' (2012) by Aliette de Bodard is set in a space dystopia where the Galactic and Rong cultures mimic contemporary issues of racism through the use of Immersers which manipulate appearance to appear ethnically Galactic. Similarly, 'The Pedestrian' (1951) by Ray Bradbury in set in a defunct future of the United States where entire cities spend their nights watching television, and the only citizen who experiences individuality, Leonard Mead, is persecuted. Although both texts were written in different time periods, the 21st and 20th century respectively, both convey a sceptical attitude towards technology. Both texts promote an intrinsic value of family, culture and human connection, alongside a critical, sceptical attitude towards technology and challenge the progressive attitudes of readers that are passionate about technology.

By presenting ==unique characterisations that contrast their dull environment==, both 'Immersion' and 'The Pedestrian' promote a strong value of human connection in society and challenge their audience’s pessimism towards in-person communication. In 'Immersion', de Bodard presents to readers a conversation between Second Uncle and Galactic Galen Santos, when Second Uncle "rubbed his hands, … a Galactic expression of satisfaction." This ==characterisation== of Second Uncle *as a financially driven person who sacrifices his connection to his Rong culture for smoother interactions with his Galactic customers* ==portrays him as immoral in his willingness to discard his cultural norms and values. This further conveys how authentic human connection is lost when Second Uncle actively suppresses his speaking habits.== In doing so, de Bodard challenges the audience’s indifference towards the necessity for human connection within society. Furthermore, in 'The Pedestrian', Leonard Mead walks down a silent street, asking the houses "What is it now? Eight-thirty P.M.? Time for a dozen assorted murders? A quiz? A revue?" Through his repetition of rhetorical questions and flamboyant actions, Leonard Mead's characterisation as embracing his freedom while being isolated from society promotes the importance of human connection in contemporary society, as it forces readers to register how bleak and mundane a world without interaction is. *In contrast, the audience’s value of technology as an indicator of scientific development and their disregard towards traditional values of human connection is challenged, as both texts articulate the dehumanising impacts of technology*. Thus, using a subtle dialogue and imagery enhanced by the lack of a response, both texts further promote the significance of human connection to the reader, challenging the audience's more apathetic views on family values.

Both 'Immersion' and 'The Pedestrian' promote a concerned attitude towards society's disregard for individuality. In 'The Pedestrian', Leonard Mead is portrayed as the only person "in a city of three million" who regularly walks down the empty streets of the city, rather than conform to society's expectations of him to spend his nights watching television. Bradbury describes how Leonard Mead was "alone in this world", and how walking through the streets "was not unequal to walking through a graveyard". Bradbury's emphasis of the streets completely devoid of life enhances the unnatural aesthetic of the empty city. Furthermore, de Bodard's 'Immersion' critiques the need for disenfranchised members of society to fit in, and how such changes harms individuality. In 'Immersion', Agnes, a native Rong who chose to constantly wear an immerser to become more Galactic, describes how "It's people like you who have to work the hardest to adjust, because so much of you draws attention to itself—the stretched eyes that crinkle in the shapes of moths, the darker skin...". Through the representation of a marginalised population changing to appear like a more prominent race, de Bodard condemns contemporary society's ostracism of unique cultures and individuals. Thus, by utilising characterisation via internal monologues, both texts emphasise the necessity for concern regarding society's desire for homogeneity.

Furthermore, both texts promote a critical attitude towards technology and its effect on individuality, challenging the expected values of their science-fiction audience. In 'Immersion', Agnes explains how immersers are "a Galactic toy", and "it takes a Galactic to believe that you can take a whole culture and reduce it to algorithms". This use of an internal dialogue further promotes a sceptical attitude towards technology. de Bodard emphasises how technology can be used to control culture and homogenise society. Similarly, Bradbury's 'The Pedestrian' further describes the uncanny ability for technology to mimic humanity, and its effect as an eradicator of individuality. When describing the "one lone car wandering and wandering the empty streets", Bradbury emphasises how the car would speak "in a metallic whisper", and how "there was no one in the front seat". This personification of the automatic police car seeks to confuse the audience, who respond with unease as the separation between humankind and technology is blurred. This works to promote a fearful attitude towards technology's ability to imitate humans, challenging the audience's endearing and hopeful attitude towards technology. Thus, by utilising personification and dialogue, both texts promote to their audiences a doubtful attitude towards technology, further challenging their audiences' own positive attitudes towards technology.

Thus, by utilising dialogue, imagery and personification, both texts successfully promote a value of human connection, and promote an antagonising attitude towards technology's effects on individuality. Furthermore, the texts critiques contemporary society's degrading attitudes towards individuality. This works to challenge the more technologically-inclined audience, opposing their progressive and endearing attitude towards technology, and a sense of disregard for technology's effect on individuality. Both text's expression of concern regarding technology's threat to individuality seeks to resonate with their audience. Both authors utilise their texts to promote their personal uneasiness over the looming threats to modern society.
