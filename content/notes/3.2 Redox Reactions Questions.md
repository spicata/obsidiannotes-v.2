1. Complete the table to summarise various ways to describe oxidisation and reduction.
	1. Oxidisation:
		1. Lose electrons
		2. Gains oxygen
		3. Loses hydrogen
		4.  Positive
	2. Reduction:
		1. Gains electrons
		2. Loses oxygen
		3. Gains hydrogen
		4. Negative

2. Iron (III) oxide + carbon:
	$Fe_2O_{3(s)} + C_{(s)} \rightarrow Fe_{(s)} + CO_{2(g)}$
	Iron oxide is reduced, and carbon is oxidised.
	Two solids are added to each other, producing a shiny solid and a gas. 
3. Copper (II) oxide + aluminium:
	$CuO_{(s)} + Al_{(s)} \rightarrow Al_2O_{3(s)} + Cu_{(s)}$
	Copper oxide is reduced, aluminium is oxidised.
