# Literature Romanticism Overview

#### Origins

Romanticism is a movement within both art and literature throughout the 18th to 19th century. It came about as a form of revolution against the previous Neoclassical movement prevalent in Europe within the 17th to 18th centuries, which promoted a return to classical Greek and Roman artistic elements.

```ad-quote
**"literature depicting emotional matter in an imaginative form"**
- *Friedrich Schlegel* in regards to romantic literature (from *Athen√§eum-Fragment*, 1798)
```

#### Prevailing principles

Primarily, romantic writers focused on the exploration of individuality, spirituality, nature, and sometimes an appreciation of isolationism as core tenants of their literature. 

In terms of literary devices, personification and pathetic fallacy were heavily utilised as a byproduct of Romanticism's greater focus on nature. Karl von Martius, an early Romantic author, used such techniques in his volume report *Flora Brasiliensis*:

```ad-quote
**"Even today those trees speak to me and fill my spirit with a certain pious fear,"**
- Karl von Martius, *Flora Brasiliensis* (1840)

```
