**Electrical Conductivity**

What process takes place when sodium becomes a sodium ion

$Na \rightarrow Na^{+}+ \bar e$


What happens to a chlorine atom when it becomes a chloride



$Cl + \bar e \rightarrow Cl^-$

**In ionic bonding, there are no delocalised electrons.**

* Ionic compounds do not conduct electricity **when they are solid**
	* Explanation: All ions (the charged particles required for electrical conductivity) are fixed in a lattice/network and cannot move while carrying charge.
* In a solid state, they are **no** mobile charged particles.

What happens in a liquid state?

If you apply enough energy, this happens:

$NaCl_{(s)} \rightarrow Na^+_{(l)}+ Cl^-_{(l)}$

These ions conduct electricity (electrolysis?)

Thus,
* Melted ionic compounds conduct electricity.
	* Ions are not fixed in a lattice, so these charged particles can move freely.

What happens if:

$NaCl_{(s)} + aq \rightarrow Na^{+}_{(aq)}+ Cl^-_{(aq)}$

You get a solution called an **electrolyte**, a solution that conducts electricity and contains charged particles (ions).
