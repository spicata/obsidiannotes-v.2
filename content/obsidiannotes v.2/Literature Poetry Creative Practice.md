**work**

A unison of sirens shrieked without hesitation
or hindrance. A unison of school-children
rose from their beds, past their confused parents,
past their pessimistic pets, past the precious perusal of pompous processed food,
into the prevailing arms of their desk, their notebooks, their computer
The pained presence of their computers lighted pressed them into their
chairs. 
Pens poured valleys of Prussian blue, words came to life
but the children pressed on, and continued to work
to work
to work.
