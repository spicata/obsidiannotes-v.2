# Title

Due Monday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Aim
The aim of the experiment is to determine the effect of temperature on rate of reaction. 

## Hypothesis
If the temperature of the reactants is increased, the rate of reaction will increase.

## Variables
- Independent Variable: Temperature ($\degree$C)
- Dependent Variable: Time taken for cross to be concealed by reaction (s)
- Controlled Variables: Concentration of reactants, species of reactants

## Table
**TAKE TABLE FROM STAWA EXPERIMENT 39!!!!!**
| Temperature $\degree C$ | Time (s) |
| ----------------------- | -------- |
| 24.4                    | 35       |
| 45                      | 8        |
| 54                      | 5.37     | 

## Graph
- Title..,
- Axis - x and y should be correctly labelled + correctly scaled
- Dots plotted correctly.
- Line of best fit

## Conclusion
- Comment if hypothesis is supported, describe relationship in graph, use trend to justify conclusion

## Evaluation
- Was experiment valid?
- Was experiment reliable?
	- Why? Why not?
- Errors
	- Random + systematic 
- Method bad, there is limited range of data points, + no repeated experiments
