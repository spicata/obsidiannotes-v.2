# Japanese Context Idea #1

1.  **Japanese - American War (1936)**

Japanese Side:

-   heavily militarized (invasion of Manchuria)
-   Around equal navy size
-   Large, fanatic army

American Side:

-   demilitarized
-   surprise invasion of Pearl Harbour, Los Angeles, etc. (Pearl Harbour but bigger)
-   Swift land invasion of the West Coast

Result:

American capitulation - cannot field a large-enough army. 3 puppet states set up - Pacific States (West Coast), Atlantic States (East Coast), Central States (everything else).

American Nationalism suppressed, mass immigration from Japan, around 20% of people in Pacific States are Japanese within a year. American ships are seized, making Japan the strongest naval power in the world. Concentration camps are set up all across the U.S., with thousands of dissidents dying daily till numbers drop a year after the capitulation.

1.  **Second Sino - Japanese War**

Delayed for a year due to invasion of the U.S. but army, backed by nationalized American industry, smashes through China. The Chinese are pushed all the way to Chengdu, where they surrender.

Results:

A Chinese puppet state is set up, while the Japanese take all coastal provinces directly - Under pressure from Japan, Siam joins the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.

1.  **Khalkhin Gaul (Japanese - Soviet Border War)**

Japanese Victory. Elite battle-hardened Japanese infantry demolish under-supplied Soviet troops with incompetent leadership. North Sakhalin is seized by the Japanese

1.  **Manchuria**

Manchuria is integrated into the greater Chinese puppet state. The puppet regime, called the "Reorganised Chinese State", comprises of smaller provinces, such as Manchuria and Mengjiang. Aisin Gioro Puyi is empowered as a puppet figure, with the actual power coming from the individual leaders of each province, all of them of Japanese origin and endlessly bickering over their power in the region. The capital is Nanjing. The Chinese government is tasked with suppressing Communist and Nationalist insurrections.

1.  **Mengjiang - Mongolian Skirmishes**

Fights between the Mongolian Communists and the militias of the province of Mengjiang, under the leadership of Demchugdongrub, Mengjiang claiming they are the natural successors of the Mongol Empire. After a string of losses and heavy casualties, an anti-communist revolt occurs in Ulaanbatar, with the communist government being overthrown before Soviet aid arrives. The provisional government subsequently leaves the Comintern and votes to re-join Mengjiang. Mengjiang is renamed "Greater Mongolia".

1.  **The Pacific States of America**

The Pacific States consists of major cities such as New Vegas, Los Angeles and Sacramento. They are given command of all Japanese naval assets in the Pacific. It is under the leadership of famed naval admiral Yamamoto. The Pacific States rapidly becomes a navally-focused regime, with its minimal army consisting of rookie Japanese conscripts and Japanese collaborators, suppressing the local population.

1.  **The Central States**

The Central States are industrialized by numerous Japanese economic plans in the region. It is the most supervised Japanese protectorate due to large rebel activity.

1.  **The Atlantic States**

The last remnants of the United States. Everything from the previous governmental system is transferred other than a Japanese-only senate having the ability to veto and create any laws. Quotas of slave labour are set by the Japanese government, with thousands of Americans sent to the Japanese Mainland.

1.  **American Resistance Movement**

Numerous resistances arise, but the most prominent is the American Revolutionary Organisation (ARO), which are most active in the Central States, due to its large amounts of workers. Their popularity in the Central States is around 50% of the population. They have executed numerous terrorist attacks, such as factory bombings and assassinations. Their growth has been stymied by Japanese public executions of known ARO members.

9.1. **The ARO**

The ARO is a broad coalition of mainly socialist underground organisations. This includes Trotskyists, Stalinists, democratic socialists, syndicalists and even anarchists. Despite their differences, they are united in their utter hatred for their Japanese overlords and believe revolution is the only way to achieve their deposition. They are currently under the leadership of a coalition between the communists and the syndicalists, their leader being Jack Reed, a newspaper writer turned syndicalist figurehead and the symbol for pro-American revolution.

1.  **The Philippines**

When the U.S. fell, they surrendered all sovereignty over the Philippines to the Japanese. After a brief military occupation, a puppet government was set up.

1.  **French Indochina**

French Indochina is seized by the Japanese with no resistance.

1.  **The British Raj**

Numerous border wars between the Raj and the Japanese occur throughout world war 2.

1.  **Anglo - Japanese Relations:**

Despite a dip in relations when the British sided with the Americans in the Treaty of Versailles, the British rekindled their friendship with the Japanese and formalise a trade pact between each other, similar to the Molotov - Ribbentrop pact in our universe. This leads to a secret agreement between the two parties, where the British lift their guarantee of the Dutch East Indies. This leads to the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies 3 months later.

1.  **American Government in Exile**

The former U.S. Government is exiled to Anchorage, in Alaska. It is the last bastion of American democracy.
