> [!NOTE] 
> The following are answers to questions done in class, given by Ms Pilling.

$Na_2CO_{3(aq)}+ 2HCl_{(aq)} \rightarrow 2NaCl_{(aq)} + CO_{2(g)} + H_2O_{(l)} \ \checkmark$

Observation: Colourless solution is added to a colourless solution, a colourless, odorless gas is produced and released through bubbles (Effervescence) from the colourless solutions.

$Ba(NO_3)_{2(aq)} + H_2SO_{4(aq)} \rightarrow BaSO_{4(s)} + 2HNO_{3(aq)} \ \checkmark$

-   all acids are stable, more or less, unless its carbonic acid
-   there are only few reactions with some metals when you have oxides formed.

examples of chemical change include PH change

e.g. NaOH + HCl → NaCl + H2O

both sides are colourless solutions (so no physical changes), how do we know that there was a chemical reaction? Change in PH levels - using PH meter

or indicators

## How do we separate things?

### Physical Means:

-   Filtration (Gravity filtration)
    -   used to separate heterogeneous mixtures composed of solids and liquids
    -   Uses a porous barrier to separate the solid from the liquid
    -   Smaller particles of liquid passes through leaving the solid in the filter paper.
    -   **Need to be able to draw a diagram**
-   Chromatography
-   Centrifuging - separate plasma from blood
-   Evaporating - similar to distillation, you evaporate solvent completely until dryness
    -   Evaporation can be used to separate a solute from the solvent in a solution.
    -   evaporating basin
-   Crystallization - if solution is not thermally stable
    -   Separation technique that results in the formation of pure solid particles from a solution containing the dissolved substance
    -   As one substance evaporates, the dissolved substance comes out of solution and collects as crystals
    -   Produces highly pure solids
    -   Rocky candy is an example of this
    -   Advantage: you will always form a pure substance, not always the case with evaporation.
-   Dissolving
-   Decantation
    -   Decanting is done to separate particulates from a liquid by allowing the solids to settle to the bottom of the mixture and pouring off the particle-free part of the liquid. Another method is to allow two immiscible liquids to separate and the lighter liquid is poured off.
-   Sieving
    -   a porous material is used to separate particles of different sizes.
    -   method is most commonly used to effect gross separations, as of liquids from suspended crystals or other solids
    -   to accelerate filtration, pressure usually is applied
    -   a series of sieves is attached, with the screen of largest hole size at the top.
-   Flotation
-   Distillation
    -   used to separate homogenous mixtures
    -   based on difference in boiling points of substances involved
    -   **Be able to draw a distillation apparatus**

Slightly soluble = soluble

-   NaCl and CuCl_2 are both soluble in water, so using water to dissolve one but not the other doesn’t work. However, in Ethanol, as NaCl has a strong ionic bond, ethanol isn’t polar enough (dipole). So NaCl will not dissolve and CuCl_2 will.

### Solutions:

-   **Solution:** A mixture in which the solute particles are homogenously distributed throughout particles of solvent
    
    -   Can be solid (e.g. Bronze(Metal alloys)), liquid (e.g. Sea water) or gas (e.g. Air)
-   **Aqueous Solution:** Liquid solution where the solvent is water
    
-   **Solvent:** The major component of a solution by mass
    
-   **Solute:** The minor components of a solution by mass
    
-   **Dissolving:** Solid particles are separated and distributed throughout the mixture, increasing solution concentration.
    
-   **Unsaturated:** Contains less solute than the solvent is normally able to dissolve
    
-   **Saturated:** Contain the same amount of solute that the solvent is normally able to dissolve
    
    -   Rate of dissolving and crystallization are equal
-   **Supersaturated:** Contains more solute than the solvent is normally able to dissolve
    
    -   Can be achieved through heating and dissolving, then carefully cooling the solution.

Solubility curves.

**Solubility is measured in how many grams of solute dissolves in 100 mL.**
