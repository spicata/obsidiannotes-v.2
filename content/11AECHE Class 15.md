Patterns in the Periodic table:

Across the period, atomic radius will decrease. (increasing electrons will increase attraction between them and nucleus, decreasing radius)

Going down groups, atomic radius will increase. (shells are being added). 

* Electrons are added to a new shell as you go down a period.
* Nuclear charge increases,
* Effective nuclear charge

Larger atoms mean that valence electrons can be lost more easily, as they are further away from the nucleus and thus experience less weak nuclear attraction force. 

**Valency**:

* *Valency is the **combining power** of an atom and is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms it could combine with or displace from a compound. (Hydrogen has a valency of 1)*
* **Valency and number of valence electrons are not the same thing**
* e.g. Nitrogen:
	* Nitrogen has a valency of 3, thus to achieve stability via gaining the electron configuration of nearest noble gas, it must lose 3 electrons. 
	* Here, the number of valence electrons is 5, but the valency is 3.
* **Principle quantum shells - refers to the shells of an atom. e.g. Sodium's principle quantum shells represents 2,8,1.**
* *Nuclear attraction is derived from the nuclear charge of an element minus the number of **inner** electrons shielding the outer electrons.*
* **Electronegative - higher density of electrons**

* Going **across** a period will **increase nuclear charge**!
* If the molecule is symmetrical it is non-polar and doesn't have dipole-dipole
