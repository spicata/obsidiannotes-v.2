Ross River Virus is an endemic RNA virus found predominantly in Australia, but has been discovered in other Pacific nations such as Papua New Guinea.  

Coming under the classification of an Alphavirus, the Ross River Virus' genome is encased within an envelope that also contains a layer of capsid proteins which makes up a protein shell.  The shape of the Ross River Virus is also spherical, and the virus itself is incredibly small, being around 70nm in diameter. The Ross River Virus is single-stranded due to it being a RNA virus.

when the virus passes through a cell's membrane, this RNA is released to order the cell's nucleus to replicate virus RNA and proteins. The presence of a protein shell (capsid) located within the membrane
