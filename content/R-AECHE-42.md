- Alkenes: **unsaturated hydrocarbons**, containing a single double bond between Carbon atoms
	- Higher ratio of carbon to hydrogen
	- More double bonds means its **not a alkene**.
- **Hydrocarbons**: containing hydrogen and carbon **only**
- **Unsaturated**: indicates the presence of a double or triple bonds 

Alkenes start with **ethene**. It is **trigonal planar**.
- Then propene. Notice, you can't have an isomer of propene.
- For butene, you *have to specify*.

**Structural isomers *only* apply for molecules of the same homologous series!!!!**
e.g.
- methylpropene, but-1-ene, and but-2-ene are all structural isomers for n-butene.
- Cyclobutane has the same molecular formula, but is **not a structural isomer** for n-butene.

**Chemical Properties of Alkenes**:
- Alkenes undergo specific type of reaction called **addition** reactions.
- In substitution, you get 2 unique products. 
- In Addition, the general formula is $A + B \rightarrow C$
- Thus, they are **very important type of organic compounds** for organic synthesis.
- In alkenes hybridisation is $sp^2$.
- Alkenes connect **pi bonds**, which are very weak, which is why alkenes are **so reactive**.
- Halogenation occurs between alkenes and ($Cl_2,Br_2,I_2$)
	- $Br_2$ is the best test for double bond (alkenes)
	- $Br_{2(aq)}$ is bromine water, an orange solution
- For example, for propene ($C_3H_6$),
	- $C_3H_{6}+ Br_{2}\rightarrow C_3H_6Br_2$
	- Propene is added to aqueous bromine, producing 1,2-dibromopropane
	- Orange solution added to colourless gas producing a colourless liquid.
		- **May not be gas! Large molecules can be liquid.**
	- $C_3H_{6}+ HCl_{(g)} \rightarrow C_3H_7Cl$
	- Propene is added to hydrogen chloride, producing 2-chloropropane
		- Markovnikov's rule states that 1-chloropropane would be a minor product of this reaction.
	- Many important industrial reactions:
		- $+H_2$ (hydrogenation) condition: Nickle catalyst for **industrial processes**
			- Catalyst reduces requirement for temperature and pressure
