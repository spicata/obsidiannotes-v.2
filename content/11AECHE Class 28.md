**Dispersion forces:**
* Non-polar molecules/atoms have small, **temporary, fluctuating dipoles** due to random movement of electrons.
* A temporary dipole induces the dipole on other molecules/atoms.
* The larger the molecule – **greater number of electrons** – the larger temporary dipoles and so **greater attractive forces between molecules, which are van der Waal's forces.**

When drawing diagrams of dispersion forces, you have to write **what type of dipole it is**.

e.g. it can be temporary or induced.

If you don't write the type of dipole, its assumed to be a permanent dipole.


**Dipole-dipole attraction:**
* Some molecules are polar. 
* Consider:
	* Symmetry
	* Difference in electronegativity of elements.
* e.g. HCl contains hydrogen and chlorine, which have significant differences in electronegativity. Also. There is no symmetry that would cancel the dipole. Thus, HCl is a polar molecule.
- Molecules with permanent dipoles have stronger forces between molecules than molecules with temporary dipoles, assuming the molecules have a relative similar size

**Hydrogen Bonding:**
- Hydrogen bonding is the electrostatic force of attraction between a hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to an NOF atom, and the lone pair of an NOF atom bonded to a hydrogen atom.
- This occurs due to the extreme difference in electronegativity, leading to a greater polarity.
- **A hydrogen bond is a strong dipole-dipole attraction between an electron deficient hydrogen atom attached to an electronegative atom (N, O, F), and the lone pairs of electrons on a highly electronegative atom on a different molecule.**
- When drawing a diagram, **always label the bond as hydrogen bonding**!

NOTE: If you're ever drawing a diagram of intermolecular forces, **label the force**.
