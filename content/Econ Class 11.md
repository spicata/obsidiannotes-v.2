# Econ Class 11

### Aggregate Demand and Supply
**This is not assessed!!!!!!!!! HOWEVER, using it is good in the assessment, but will not be marked down for not using it. Don't lose marks for getting it wrong.**
- What is aggregate demand?
	- **Total** demand in an economy
		- If you demand something, it doesn't mean you can get it.
		- Who demands? Households through consumption, firms through investment, government through government spending, and export sector. (**Net exports = exports - imports**)
	- Total **output** in an economy.
	- *What happens when aggregate demand is greater or lower than aggregate supply?*
	- Components of aggregate demand:
		- Consumption Expenditure - Consumption
			- Spending by **consumers - every person in economy, including firms, government, etc.**
			- Durable goods, e.g. houses
			- Non-durable goods, *lasts 3 years or less* e.g. perishable food
			- Services, e.g. education
			- 60% of aggregate demand.
		- Investment Expenditure
			- Spending on capital, e.g. machinery, **factories** and anything that can produce thing, which will produce goods and services in the future.
			- Refers to business and housing investment or inventories
		- Government Expenditure
			- G1: current (consumption) expenditure which are part of the day to day functions of government.
				- This refers to the set budget for the upkeep of the services/goods it provides.
				- e.g. There is a daily payment to the school for it to continue its servicing of education.
				- This usually cannot be changed.
			- G2: capital (investment) expenditure to provide for future needs such as schools, roads, etc.
				- Government invests money into improving existing goods/services or providing new things.

**Fiscal policy is when government changes G2 to boost or lower economic activity. G1 is essentially constant.**

**Aggregate Demand curve: how to change it**
- Taxation - income changes, changing consumption
- Interest Rates
- Changes in supply
- Deregulation?
- Government spending
- Immigration
- Trade policy
- Wage changes
- Everything here is something to do with consumption, investment or government.
- This is because anything that changes these things change aggregate demand
- To move the curve, we must change these factors.

**What is aggregate supply?**
- The **total** amount of goods and services produced in an economy at a given price level over a given period of time. It is essentially the sum of all the supply curves of individual producers
- This is exactly the same as GDP, as GDP measures value of output, which is essentially the same
- We strive to be at equilibrium, where **aggregate supply** = **aggregate demand**
	- It's not bad or good, its simply when the 2 things are equal.
	- You can have equilibrium in both depression and boom.
- An economy will never be at equilibrium, as there are too many everchanging factors.
- However, our economy is trying to be at equilibrium.
- Currently, aggregate demand is exceeding aggregate supply.
	- This means the producers cannot produce everything that people want.
	- This causes the price of the products to increase.
	- As the **price level** rises, demand will decrease as *people cannot afford it*. This is called the **income effect**.
	- Eventually, through price levels, we reach a point of "equilibrium" in a sense where aggregate demand reduces to the point where it meets aggregate supply.
	- The opposite applies, when we increase supply of a goods to match aggregate demand, prices will fall as we reach a point where aggregate demand reach a point.
	- **TLDR; Markets always move towards equilibrium, but will never get there due to imbalance between aggregate demand and supply.**

- *Aggregate Supply curve* is the relationship between aggregate supply and the general price level.
- Aggregate supply is total amount of goods/services produced, but does that mean the economy is at full capacity?
- No! This is why the aggregate supply curve exists, the change in aggregate supply represents capacity utilization.

Note: when supply curve moves to left, this is called a **supply shock**.
- Increasing capacity translates curve to right, decreasing capacity translate curve to left.

==Fiscal policy is **demand-side**!!!==

***Aggregate supply can increase, but it does so if:***
- Labour or capital increases
- New technologies are adopted
- Productivity increases
- Price for key natural resources falls => This is a massive issue, and usually causes supply shocks.
- Wage expectations fall
	- It will shift left if a supply shock occurs.

Fiscal policy's purpose is to maintain stability in an economy via impacting economic activity, and to meet the government objectives.

### Fiscal Policy (finally)
The purpose of fiscal policy is to affect the level of economic activity, and meet the government's economic projections/objectives.
- It also aims to affect resource allocation and income distribution.

**Budget**: statement of *expected* revenue and *expected* expenditure over the financial year.

When budget is written, the parts for G1 things are pretty accurate, as they have good enough data on the things already. However, things like **unemployment benefits** are usually inaccurate, as this could be changed by changes in the economy.
