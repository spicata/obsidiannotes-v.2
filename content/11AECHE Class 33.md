**Gas Chromatography:**
- GC is used widely in many analytical laboratories, including forensic police labs, synthetic chemical labs, and drug testing labs.
- GC uses a stationary phase to impede the movement of a mobile test substance.
- Different substances are attracted to the matrix by different amounts, and therefore journey along it at different speeds.
- In GC, the sample is injected into the machine, where it is vaporised. It is then washed over the matrix by an **inert gas**.
	- **Low molar mass** gasses required:
	- Hydrogen
	- Helium
	- Nitrogen
- Some substances will be more attracted to the matrix than others. These will take much longer to reach the detector.
- The detector measures the abundance of a substance at a given time, and this data is plotted on a graph.
- Most polar = one that travels slowest.
- MP under pressure passed through column containing SP

**HPLC:**
- High performance liquid chromatography is a development of column chromatography in which the eluent is pumped through the column at **high pressure**.
- This results in better and faster separation than can be achieved in standard column chromatography.
- MP- liquid (usually a mixture of Water/acetonitrile/methanol)
- MP under pressure passed through column containing SP (silica)
- Sample must be soluble in MP
- Suitable for high molecular weight samples.
- Samples **must** be soluble

**Chromatograms:**
- Retention time is a similar measure of the interaction between compounds and MP/SP.

Gas chromatography is not that useful for identifying substances (it is better as a separation technique). When used with Mass spectrometry, it becomes very effective.

**Most important (chromatography method) is *paper and TLC***.
