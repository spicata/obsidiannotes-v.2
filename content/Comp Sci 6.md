# Comp Sci 6

# Networks!

- PAN: Personal Area network, things in your personal area e.g. mobile phones
- LAN: Local Area network, things local to you, e.g. your neighbourhood
- MAN: Metropolitan Area network, things in your city
- WAN: Wide Area network, things around the world, the stuff that connects countries

What is a network?

Two or more technological devices become connected to each other. The way they are connected to each other is considered **transmission media**.

There are 2 types of transition media:
- **Wired**: Ethernet cable, fibre-optic cable,
- **Wireless**: Bluetooth, microwave/satellite

Important concept: **Protocols**

Protocols have names and numbers, e.g. ip.

- Ip stands for **internet protocol**, this is essential for where packaged information is send and received.
- This is related for the addresses to which data is sent, e.g. IPV4, and IPV6

IPV4 is made of 32 bits, 

byte is 8 bits, each bit is a number. These numbers can be an address. this amount of possibilities allows for multiple options

But we are running out of addresses, so we make IPV6, with 128 bits, but this is too big, so we use hexadecimal.

This is all part of a protocol.
