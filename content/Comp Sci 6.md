# Comp Sci 6

# Networks!

- PAN: Personal Area network, things in your personal area e.g. mobile phones
- LAN: Local Area network, things local to you, e.g. your neighbourhood
- WLAN: **Wireless Local Area network**
- MAN: Metropolitan Area network, things in your city
- WAN: Wide Area network, things around the world, the stuff that connects countries
- **Cloud Based Network**

What is a network?

Two or more technological devices become connected to each other. The way they are connected to each other is considered **transmission media**.

There are 2 types of transition media:
- **Wired**: Ethernet cable, fibre-optic cable,
- **Wireless**: Bluetooth, microwave/satellite

Important concept: **Protocols**

Protocols have names and numbers, e.g. ip.

- Ip stands for **internet protocol**, this is essential for where packaged information is send and received.
- This is related for the addresses to which data is sent, e.g. IPV4, and IPV6

IPV4 is made of 32 bits, 

byte is 8 bits, each bit is a number. These numbers can be an address. this amount of possibilities allows for multiple options

But we are running out of addresses, so we make IPV6, with 128 bits, but this is too big, so we use hexadecimal.

This is all part of a protocol.

# How to connect to the internet?

A **modem** connects to the internet. 

Modem stands for modulator-demodulator,
it modulates from analogue to digital, and then demodulates from digital to analogue.

In our home, we only have one device, called a **router**. The role of the router is sending packages of data to all the devices in a network.

What is a firewall? It is a **software**. It **filters packages** and checks if they are malicious packages or not. Will prevent viruses, malware, etc. that could possibly attack the local network

These 3 devices, a *modem*, *firewall*, and *router*, make up the things that link devices to the internet.

But there are more complex components of a local network. 

We will use **cisco** to map out these networks.

Our "stupid computers" connect to the internet via the **Wireless Access Point**.



But, if we were to send files to the shared storage for example, we *don't use internet*. 

*Servers* are computer with a lot of memory and space, and serve as storages for data. The **shared drive** stores data on the server. 
- It can store all types of data, e.g. programs, music, pictures, etc.
