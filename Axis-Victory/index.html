After Churchill fails to convince his war cabinet to continue the war during the War cabinet crisis of May 1940, he is toppled by the tory majority in the House of Commons and replaced by Halifax.</p><p>Halifax then seeks peace directly with the Germans, whose first demands are a German garrison in Dover. This is rejected by Halifax, which results in the complete and utter annihilation of London after the superior Luftwaffe bombers rain down a barrage of explosives onto tired and broken British anti-air men. After which, the British reapproached the Germans and accepted unconditional surrender. The British Parliament is dissolved, as a puppet civilian government named &ldquo;Reichskommissariat Britannien&rdquo; takes control of the British isles. The majority of British owned Africa, including South Africa, is transferred to the Italians, excluding Egypt and the Middle East.</p><p>With the fall of the Allied Powers, the United States reaffirms their ideals of Isolationism under F.D.R.. Operation Barbarossa is executed as planned, and with even faster speeds, due to the land army being reinforced with the Afrika Korps and their panzers. With the Soviet Union being demoralized by the fall of the U.K., a peace treaty is signed where all territory is ceded to Germany up to the Ural Mountains.</p><a href=#story---event-timeline-essentially><h1 id=story---event-timeline-essentially><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><strong>Story - Event timeline essentially:</strong></h1></a><p><strong>Part 1 - Prelude</strong></p><p>With all their enemies defeated and German hegemony asserted over Europe, the Reichstag is tasked with dividing all the new territories. In the end, the Benelux became a Reichskommissariat, including the German owned territories of France, Ukraine, Ostland (The Baltics) and Russia. Poland becomes an integrated puppet state, named the Generalgouvernement.</p><p>After a year of the Carving of Europe, Germany executed a large-scale invasion of Scandinavia, conquering Norway, Sweden and Finland in only a month. A new Reichskommissariat is set up, &ldquo;Reichskommissariat Skandinavien&rdquo;. With approval from Hitler, the Spanish State under Franco joined the Axis and invaded Portugal, destroying the Portuguese and annexing the entirety of Portugal. It is forced to rename itself to &ldquo;Reichskommissariat Spanien.&rdquo;</p><p>At the same time, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria are forced by Germany to unite, with each nationality being given partial autonomy. They banded together to create the nation known as &ldquo;Reichskommissariat Balkan&rdquo;.</p><p>Mussolini, disappointed by their gains in the end of world war 2, declares the Second Vittoria Mutilata (Mutilated Victory), announcing their ambitions to achieve their own type of lebensraum for all Italian people.</p><p>After seizing a large portion of Yugoslavia, a military government is set up, named the &ldquo;Governo Militare Balcanico&rdquo;. The Greek people are given partial autonomy, under the civilian government &ldquo;Nazione Greca&rdquo;. Their Africa holdings are separated into 2 Military Governments, the &ldquo;Governo Militare Nord-Africano&rdquo; and &ldquo;Governo Militare Mediorientale&rdquo;.</p><p>After Mustafa Kemal Ataturk&rsquo;s death, nationalists in the country seized power in Turkey, in an elitist paramilitary coup. Under the leadership of Alparslan Türkeş, Turkey aligns itself to Italy.</p><p>With the fall of Petain in Vichy France by a military sponsored coup d&rsquo;état, the remnants of the French Republic distance themselves from the war-mongering Germans and align themselves with Italy.</p><p>After both France and Turkey declared their support for Italy, they signed a defensive treaty to come to each other&rsquo;s assistance in the event of a German invasion. This treaty is called the Malta Pact, signed within the Italian-Occupied city of Malta.</p><p>After the Soviet Union is banished into the Siberian winter, parts of the Union starts to fall apart. Around 7 months after the Carving of Europe, Kazakhstan and numerous other countries declare independence simultaneously within a single month&rsquo;s period. This leads to a final wave of disapproval for Stalin&rsquo;s totalitarian police state, with him being removed and his body being hung in Red Square. The Union dissolves after Stalin&rsquo;s death, with 2 Russia&rsquo;s being created after, Red Russia and White Russia, which subsequently fall into a civil war. Siberia is also freed, but no central authority comes into power, leaving Siberia an anarchist wasteland.</p><p>Hitler, having now won World War 2, lives the rest of his life in relative quiet, as he ages. Factionalism within the Reichstag, which frequently meets in a refurbished Reichstag Building, increases, with conservatives fighting the militarist and liberal factions of the NSDAP.</p><p>As Hitler reaches the age of 76, on the 20th of April, 1965, he suffers a massive stroke, leaving him paralysed for a week. This leaves the German Reich in chaos, which is only solved when a hastily made coalition consisting of most factions of the NSDAP excluding the fanatical SS write a new enabling act in the Reichstag, basically giving them the power to make laws without Hitler&rsquo;s presence, essentially creating a government without a prime minister.</p><p>Hitler, now on his deathbed, officially rescinds his dictatorial powers to the Reichstag, which dissolves the role of fuhrer as Hitler passes. Hitler dies a month after his stroke.</p><p>The current status of the Reichstag is an uneasy calm. While the coalition, named the Unity-Koalition prevents the largest faction within the Reichstag, the SS Loyalists, from taking control over Germany, neither of the 3 main factions of the coalition can assume power, as if one tries to the other two will disassemble the coalition, sending Germany into chaos.</p><p>The 3 factions of the Unity-Koalition includes the moderate faction, the largest faction of the coalition under the leadership of Martin Bormann, the Militarist wing, throwing their support behind Hermann Goering, and the reformist faction, headed by Albert Speer.</p><p>The SS faction falls under the leadership of Esoteric fascist Heinrich Himmler, however his control over the SS is challenged by popular German SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich.</p><p>The death of Hitler causes millions of loyal, confused and scared Germans to march in the streets in commemoration of the man who made Germany the leader of the world. At his official funeral, thousands of NSDAP officials are seated with the 3 leaders of the coalition being allowed to make their own speech. Himmler is not invited to speak, however he is given a front row seat to the funeral and an elite Waffen-SS panzer regiment parades Hitler&rsquo;s body around Berlin.</p><p>With stability in the German Reich secured, the coalition declares war on both Russias, which are still at war with each other, and the anarchist Siberia, in the name of expanding Reichskommissariat Moskowien (Germany&rsquo;s Russian puppet state) and protecting the fabled Moskau from raids done by anarchists in Russia. With the Army, Navy and Airforce fully cooperating with each other, the German Reich executes the quickest invasion ever seen since the initial invasion of Russia during Operation Barbarossa. Elite panzer divisions demolish disorganized Russian troop formations as both Russia&rsquo;s capitulate within the month of November, 1966. All conquered lands except for Siberia are given to Reichskommissariat Moskowien, which is renamed Reichskommissariat Russland.</p><p>Russian fascists within the white army, seeing German domination over Russia inevitable, defect and turn against the white leadership on the 17th November, causing the storming of the Whites capital, Vladivostok, by the Russian fascists, united under the leadership of Konstantin Rodzaevsky, after immigrating to White Russia from Harbin, Manchukuo to help the war effort.</p><p>Konstantin Rodzaevsky and his Russian Fascist Party (RFP) met with delegates of the Reichstag the next day in Yekaterinburg, where the last tsar was murdered by Soviet guards. The city was recently captured by the modern panzer divisions of the Wehrmacht. During their meeting the RFP agrees to destroy the Whites from the inside in exchange for local autonomy over Russia. The Germans agree, and the Whites meet the same fate as they did in the first Russian civil war.</p><p>With Siberia conquered, Heinrich Himmler is appointed Reichskommissar of Reichskommissariat Sibirien. He &lsquo;graciously&rsquo; accepts, and he moves to Vladivostok, renamed Wladiwostok.</p><p>The fall of Russia sends shockwaves throughout the world, reaffirming German dominance over the old world. The new world, however, stands firm against the fascist eagle and remains the land of the free. Canada and Mexico voluntarily join the U.S., now the North American Union (NAU). This brings the total stars on the flag to a large 92.</p><p>Merely days after the capitulation of the remnants of the Soviet Union in Russia, delegates from the independent French state, the Turkish nation and the Italian Empire meet in Italian-occupied Cairo to discuss the creation of the Mare (Mediterranean) Triumvirate. Within 2 weeks, all delegates leave the conference room to announce the formalization of the alliance.</p><p>The newly formed NAU, seeing the rise of a bulwark against Germany hegemony in Europe, immediately recognizes the Italian-aligned France as the legitimate government of France, and talks begin between the NAU and delegates from all member nations of the Triumvirate about a potential greater defensive pact against Germany. However, these talks break down and eventually go nowhere.</p><p>1968 goes down in this history as one of the most significant years of U.S/NAU history, with the Elections of 1968 as the final showdown between liberal democrats and the rising anti-fascist coalition. The coalition is made up of anarchists, socialists and left-wing democrats, led by former Democrat Hubert Humphrey, a placeholder president due to how divided the coalition is. The liberal democrats are the Democrat-Republican Party, which united 3 months before the election in the name of defending democracy within the NAU. They come under the leadership of widely popular Republican Henry Kissinger, who calls for peace and pioneers the policy of détente with the German Reich.</p><p>The election is incredibly close, with the Democrat-Republican Party barely passing the 270 votes required by just 3. However, this doesn&rsquo;t stop intense riots across the U.S., building up to the Nashville Massacre, when thousands of anti-fascists stormed the Democrat-owned State Capital and murdered everyone inside, declaring the state of Tennessee an independent state and holding the building for 2 days, until the army executed a siege on the capital. During the siege the anti-fascists fought till their last breath, some falling next to the corpses of their own victims.</p><p>Kissinger&rsquo;s victory speech calls for unity within these dark times, yet affirms his belief in preserving democracy across the world, by announcing his first act will be to safeguard nations that are democratic or are friendly to democracy.</p><p>Tragedy strikes the NAU as President Henry Kissinger is assassinated by a supposed Japanese agent during a rally for the 1970 midterm elections. As the president was driving to Florida State University to deliver a speech to its students, he was shot in the neck by a sniper as the car took a turn. Supporters watched in fear as the president slowly suffocated on his own blood, with both his wife and driver killed by the sniper. Secret Service agents rushed out from the cars in the president’s motorcade to find Kissinger unconscious, his suit soaked in blood. He was quickly rushed to the Capital Regional Medical Center, however the doctors weren’t able to save him in time.</p><p>Within minutes of his death, an emergency announcement is broadcasted to all citizens of the NAU by Kissinger’s Vice President, Democrat Edmund Muskie. With a heavy heart, he confirms Kissinger’s death in the assassination, and swears to avenge his death by finding the perpetrators. The assassin is quickly caught, and is revealed to be an undoccumented Japanese man, quickly raising suspicions on Japan for their involvement in Kissinger’s assassination.</p><p>36 minutes after Muskie’s broadcast, the Japanese make their own announcement hosted by their delegate to the NAU. In the announcement they both condone the assassination and deny any involvement in it, claiming that the assassin in question was actually a former Japanese agent turned German Gestapo sleeper agent. The Reichstag doesn’t comment on this accusation.</p><p>This announcement, however, is not enough for the NAU as the entire Pacific fleet heads to Pearl Harbor, and naval exercises occur near the Japanese Co-Prosperity Sphere’s maritime border. In retaliation, the Japanese set their naval fleet to full combat readiness, and prepare plans for quick aerial attacks on NAU bases in the Pacific.</p><p>In the end, the Japanese strike first. 2 weeks after Kissinger’s assassination, The Japanese engages the American navy north of Wake island, with the Battle of Wake resulting in a decisive Japanese victory, however each side takes heavy material losses, with a total of 15 carriers being sunk.</p><p>Despite Japanese victory in the Battle of Wake, the Imperial navy is forced to retreat back to the home islands to repair, making the Pacific ocean uncontested. The NAU uses this opportunity to declare a state of war between the NAU and Japanese Empire, allowing Muskie to heavily militarize the American economy, and setting aside billions of dollars to fund a naval buildup never seen before.</p><p>While the Americans prepare, so do the Japanese, with fortifications being built across the entirety of Japan, making a naval invasion impossible. The Japanese also launch their plan for a swift conquest of American holdings in the Pacific, however they only are able to gain a foot-hold in a vast minority of the islands, and are forced to entrench themselves until one of the two powers can acquire naval superiority over the other.</p><p>With naval domination temporarily achieved, Muskie uses this opportunity to execute Operation Overthrow, with an elite task force of American marines landing in Tokyo and overwhelming the city’s defenses. The Japanese emperor, Akihito, barely escapes from the palace before it is burnt down.</p><p>What will soon become known as the Burning of Tokyo sparks a fire in the Japanese population as countless, heavily unarmed, Japanese citizens charge the capital in a desperate attempt to completely wipe out the Americans. They succeed through the use of human wave tactics, however at a horrible price. 500 thousand Japanese soldiers die, in exchange for killing 10 thousand Americans. This massacre demonstrates to Muskie that conventional means of warfare will not win the war.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;—</p><p><strong>Part 2 - Die Großen Krisen - The Great Crises</strong></p><p>1970 marks one of the greatest crisis within the German Reich, as Konstantin Rodzaevsky and his cabinet are executed in an well planned coup by prominent Russian fascist Anastasy Vonsiatsky, who immediately declares Reichskommissariat Russland, now the Russian State, an independent nation, and seeks to reclaim the Russian Empire&rsquo;s former territories.</p><p>Within hours, Russian troops build fortifications in the Ural Mountains. With mountain fortifications making it almost impossible to attack, German troops can only watch as a surprisingly organized Russian Army invades Central Asia, crushing their resistance and reaching the bottom right of the Caspian Sea within a month. The Reichstag avoids discussing the clear rebellion for 2 months until border skirmishes happen between the bolstered Russian shock troopers and the disenchanted SS army in Siberia. In response, 70% of all Waffen-SS Panzer divisions are rerouted to Siberia, however upon reaching Wladiwostok find the harsh Siberian wasteland too difficult to sustain a military campaign. Realizing the only viable front is Central Asia, the division in Wladiwostok are once again rerouted to mobilize on the southern border of the Russian State.</p><p>Despite German technological advancements, the panzers are unable to prepare for battle before the Russians secure and fortify their entire border with the German Empire. Despite firm demands for the Russians to be left alone by both the NAU and Japanese Empire, the elite Fallschirmjäger, under the guidance of paratrooper genius Kurt Student, manage to execute a large-scale airborne invasion of the Russian State’s capital in Ekaterinburg. The undermanned and undertrained defenders of the city stood no match against the greatest soldiers produced by the Third Reich and they reached the center of the city.</p><p>&lsquo;Anastasy Vonsiatsky, expecting the Germans to rush into his heavily fortified governmental building, is shocked to see the German troops retreating. However, he has little time to find out why as a modified version of the V-2 rocket detonates directly on top of the building, instantly vaporising anyone inside and turns the building into rubble and debris. Hours after the attack, all 3 leaders of the Unity-Koalition make a press announcement, stating “Through superior German will, the Russian tyrant has been executed. We welcome all those who wish to surrender before we liberate your homeland.”&rsquo; - anecdote?</p><p>Both the NAU and Japanese fall silent after this display of German supremacy. Without a strong leader and international support, the Russian State collapses in a day. With brigades on the border mutinying and even turning on each other, the Wehrmacht High Command executes Phase 2 of their plan, a carefully targeted aerial campaign, seeking to both wreak havoc on ground forces and flatten major cities. This final move is the nail in the coffin for the Russian State, as the army leaders still alive from the attack all offer unconditional surrender.</p><p>The de facto capitulation of the Russian State allows the reichstag to balkanise Russia into 3 states:  Reichskommissariat Moskowien, Reichskommissariat Ostrussland (East Russia) and Reichskommissariat Westsibirien (West Siberia). Reinhard Heydrich is made Reichskommissar of Moskowien, weakening Himmler’s control over the SS.</p><p>Heydrich’s rule over Moskowien leads to thousands of deaths daily, as he orders the execution of those he deems unworthy and sends the rest to work in labor camps. This turns Moskau into a ghost city, with only Germans left there to profit from the properties seized from the Russian people.</p><p>Years later, the second crisis of the Reich begins as Heydrich publicly denounces Himmler’s rule over the SS in a speech made in Moskau. As fanatical SS soldiers cheer loudly, the elite divisions of the Waffen-SS are split as they militarise on both borders of Ostrussland. With imminent invasion upon them, the central government of the kommissariat collapses, prompting a swift push from both sides of the SS to secure as much of the former Russian land as possible for the upcoming struggle.</p><p>This pure defiance of the reichstag causes heated debate within it, and the 3 leaders eventually decide to demand both sides demilitarise or face consequences.</p><p>Unfortunately for the slavic people of Ostrussland, neither side compromises, and Ostrussland descends into all out chaos within weeks. SS-Battalions form and attack defensive lines, and civilian casualties reach past 50k within a month.</p><p>Himmler and Heydrich both send the call for loyal units to relocate to the border, and panzers fight panzers in the thick Russian snow. Heydrich’s elite soldiers storm the city of Novosibirsk, massacring all inhabitants and preparing to transform the ruins of the city into the most heavily fortified bastion in Russia.</p><p>Himmler attempts to gain advantage in the north, routing the majority of his panzer strike-force towards Noril’sk, meeting Heydrichs Einsatzgruppen. The battle that ensued lasted 3 days, and was a decisive Heydrich victory, as the Einsatzgruppen employed guerilla tactics to slowly pick off Himmler’s tanks.</p><p>This split in the SS doesn’t stop at just Ostrussland, as the entirety of the Reich erupts in upheaval, as brother fights brother in the streets of Berlin. However, with superior weaponry and tacticionship, Heydrich defeats Himmler and in the final days of Himmler’s control over the SS, he orders his remaining divisions to spread out through Ostrussland and form partisan groups, brutally slaughtering the already diminishing population of the countryside.</p><p>With Himmler out of the picture, Heydrich assumed command of the entirety of the Russian lands, establishing Reichskommissariat Russland. The struggle is not over, however, as the Unity-Koalition demands that Heydrich dismantle his empire into 2 states, with the Reichstag taking control over Sibirien, and Heydrich’s SS retaining leadership of Zentralrussland.</p><p>After a tense showdown between the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS, Heydrich agrees to the terms and subsequently helps appoint a new government to the Sibirien lands.</p><p>This civil war within the SS does not go unnoticed to the wider world, as rebels across the reichskommissariats prepare to revolt. Merely 3 months after Himmler’s fall from grace, an international partisan organisation known as the “Free Liberation Force” stages a reich-wide insurrection across the Reich’s colonies, mainly in Spain and Scandinavia. This small insurrection quickly leads to an open revolt against the reich within its colonies, as the governments of Spanien, Skandinavien and Ukraine are dissolved and democratic liberties are restored to their people. During the chaos, numerous separatist partisan groups rise up, such as the Polish Home Army, in the Warsaw Insurrection, and various other rebels, such as British fascists near London, the Russian Red Army and the Paris Commune. - <strong>1970-80s??</strong></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;—</p><p><strong>Part 3 - Fugue</strong></p><p>Actor 1: <em><strong>Felipe González Márquez</strong></em></p><p>Born under the Francoist regime imposed by the Germans, Felipe experienced firsthand the tyranny of Franco, which was further enhanced under the direction of the Nazi party. Studying at Seville University, he met his soon-to-be comrades of the <em>Spanish Socialist Workers&rsquo; Party.</em> Throughout Franco&rsquo;s regime, he would be the main figurehead of anti-Falangist sentiment, slowly organising and gaining popularity. After witnessing the many crises of the Greater German Reich, he, alongside his many friends of liberty across the Reich, would rise up to form the &ldquo;Free Liberation Force&rdquo;.</p><p>Actor 2: <em><strong>Johan Nygaardsvold</strong></em></p><p>A vague character in Norwegian politics, Johan quickly rose to prominence when he was asked to form a government by the Norwegian Monarchy. However, his government would not last long against the tide of Nazi aggression. He would run said government as an exiled one in London. With the fall of London, he used his obscurity to return to Norway, where he would slowly build up resistance to Vidkun Quisling&rsquo;s regime. Throughout the years, his resistance movement spread throughout the entirety of Scandinavia, gradually intensifying attacks on the fascist government. When the time came, he would rise up along his brothers in arms to create the &ldquo;Free Liberation Force&rdquo;.</p><a href=#pictures><h1 id=pictures><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><strong>Pictures:</strong></h1></a><p>Scenario One Map (unfinished):</p><p>lol it corrupted kekw</p><p>Europe Free Liberation Force + Separatists</p><p><img src="/obsidiannotes-v.2/Pasted image 20220508202858.png" width=auto></p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://eddietheed.github.io/obsidiannotes-v.2/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Edward Huynh using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://eddietheed.github.io/obsidiannotes-v.2/>Home</a></li><li><a href=DefinitelyEddie#5369>Discord</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
