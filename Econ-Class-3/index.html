This theory produced the permanent income hypothesis which explained why short-term tax increases actually decrease savings and keep consumption levels static, all else being equal, (That is, people will draw down on their savings to maintain the level of consumption if taxes are increased).</li><li>If short term tax increase, people will <strong>draw down on savings</strong> to <strong>maintain level of consumption</strong>, <em>rather than reduce</em> level of consumption.</li><li><strong>Permanent</strong> tax increases <strong>will affect</strong> level of consumption</li><li>Inflation is a monetary phenomenon. It is driven by <strong>too much money</strong>.</li></ul><blockquote><p>The most famous excerpt from Friedman&rsquo;s writings and speeches is, &ldquo;Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.&rdquo; He defied the intellectual climate of his era and reasserted the quantity theory of money as a viable economic tenet. In a 1956 paper titled &ldquo;Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money,&rdquo; Friedman found that, in the long run, increased monetary growth increases prices but does not really affect output.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Friedman&rsquo;s work busted the classic Keynesian dichotomy on inflation, which asserted that prices rose from either ‚Äùcost-push‚Äù or ‚Äúdemand-pull‚Äù sources. It also put monetary policy on the same level as fiscal policy.</li><li><strong>Both Keynes and Friedman are correct.

==KEY CONCEPT OF A MARKET ECONOMY IS THE LAWS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND==</p></li><li><p>A market economy is a system where the <strong>laws of supply and demand</strong> <em>direct</em> the production of goods and services</p></li><li><p>Supplies includes natural resources, land, labour and enterprie - Factors of Production</p></li><li><p>Demands include purchases by consumers, business and the government.</p></li><li><p>Businesses sell their wares at the highest price consumers will pay.</p></li><li><p>At the same time, shoppers <strong>look for the lowest prices</strong> for the goods and services they want.</p></li><li><p>Workers bid their services at the highest possible wages that their skills allow.</p></li><li><p>Employers seek to get the best employees at the <strong>lowest possible price</strong></p></li><li><p>Equilibrium when what they are willing to sell is the same as when you are willing to buy</p></li><li><p>Unions are a response to when an individual has to negotiate with larger company. It allows people to control wages of a specific job and where competition can work together to advocate for better wages.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Market Economy characteristics:</strong></p><ul><li>Private Property<ul><li>One of the most important characteristics of a market economy</li><li>Most goods and services are privately owned</li><li>The owners can make legally-binding contracts to buy, sell or lease their property.</li><li>In other words, their assets give them the right to profit from ownership.</li><li>Important because gives <strong>sense of security, and has the financial motivation to improve and increase efficiency of a property.</strong></li></ul></li><li>Freedom of choice<ul><li>You decide what you buy, sell and produce.</li><li>Most importantly, you operate in a <strong>competitive market</strong>.</li><li>There are 2 constrains:<ul><li>First is the price at which they are willing to buy or sell. In truly competitive markets, the market will determine the price. You can&rsquo;t choose, or else you will not profit</li><li>Second is the amount of capital they have.</li></ul></li><li>Motive of Self-Interest<ul><li>People are driven by self-interest, want to sell products to highest bidder, and want to negotiate to buy things at the lower price.</li><li>This will lead to benefit for the economy in the long term.</li><li>Auction system sets prices for goods and services that reflect their market value.</li><li>It gives an <strong>accurate picture of supply and demand at any given moment.</strong></li></ul></li><li>Competition<ul><li>MUST have competition in a market place.</li><li><strong>The force of competitive pressure keeps prices low. It also ensures that society provides goods and services most efficiency.</strong><ul><li>When in competition, people work to be the best for the consumers.</li></ul></li><li>As soon as demand increases for a particular item, prices rise thanks to the law of demand.</li><li>Competitors see they can enhance their profits by producing it, adding to supply.</li><li>This lowers prices to a level where only the best competitors.</li></ul></li><li>System of Markets and Prices<ul><li>A market economy relies on an efficient market in which to sell goods and market<ul><li>This is realistically not true.</li></ul></li><li>That&rsquo;s where all the buyers and sellers have equal access to the same information.</li><li>Price changes are pure reflections of the laws of supply and demand.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Limited</strong> government<ul><li>The role of government is to ensure that the markets are open and working.</li><li>For example, it is in charge of national defence to protect the markets. It also make sure that everyone has <strong>equal access to the markets. The government penalizes monopolies that restrict competition.</strong></li><li>It makes sure no one is manipulating the markets and that everyone has equal access to information.</li><li>Government should not interfere in government, should make sure market is efficient</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Planned/Command Economy:</p><ul><li>When a <strong>central government makes all economic decisions</strong>.</li><li>Either the government or a collective owns the land and the means of production.</li><li><em><strong>It doesn&rsquo;t rely on the laws of supply and demand that operate in a market economy.</strong></em></li><li>In recent years, many <strong>centrally-planned economies</strong> began adding aspect of the market economy. The resultant mixed economy better achieves their goals</li><li>America has been introducing <strong>supply-side economics</strong> (related to command?), people don&rsquo;t learn from mistakes</li></ul><p>What happens?</p><ul><li>The government creates a <strong>central economic plan setting economic and societal goals</strong> for every sector and region of the country</li><li><em>The government allocates all resources according to this central plan</em></li><li>People <strong>must</strong> work to follow this plan.</li><li><strong>It tries to use the nation&rsquo;s capital, labour and natural resources in the most <em>efficient way possible.</em></strong></li><li>It promises to use each people&rsquo;s skills and abilities to their highest capacity seeking to eliminate unemployment.</li><li>1 Positive: 0 Unemployment!!!</li></ul><p>The central plan:</p><ul><li>Sets the priorities for the production of all goods and services.</li><li>These include <strong>quotas</strong> and <strong>price controls</strong>. Its goal is to supply enough <strong>food, housing and other basics</strong> to meet the needs of everyone in the country.<ul><li>In a market economy, government uses other means to influence prices compared to price controls e.g. interest rate</li></ul></li><li>It also sets national priorities which include mobilizing for war or generating robust economic growth.</li></ul><p>Government:</p><ul><li><strong>The government creates laws, regulations, and directives to enforce the central plan</strong></li><li>Businesses follow the plan&rsquo;s production and hiring targets.</li><li>They can&rsquo;t respond on their own to free market forces.</li><li>Government owns monopoly businesses. These are in industries deemed essential to the goals of the economy.</li><li>These usually includes finance, utilities, and automotive.</li><li><em>There is no domestic competition in these sectors.</em></li></ul><p>The command economy is a key feature of any communist society.</p><ul><li>Cuba, North Korea and the former Soviet Union are examples of countries that have command economies.</li><li>China maintained a command economy for decades before transitioning to a <strong>mixed economy</strong> that <em>features both communistic and capitalistic elements,</em></li></ul><p>Mixed economy:</p><ul><li>System that combines characteristics of market, command and traditional economies.
