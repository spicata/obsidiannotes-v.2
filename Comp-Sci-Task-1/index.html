It may also be considered an entertainment app, but its primary focus is as a digital tool to improve a user&rsquo;s interaction with their computer.</li><li>Once initialized, the voice assistant will listen to the user and execute a range of functions, such as opening Firefox, opening Obsidian (note-taking app), etc. There is also some quality-of-life functions for the program, such as closing the program.</li><li>As stated before, the target audience is students, as I feel that most students could use a voice assistant in terms of managing and further optimizing their computer usage, aiming predominantly for greater ease of use.</li><li>I aim to create a voice assistant that will allow increased productivity when using their computer for study or work. The target audience, myself included, wish to increase their personal productivity when studying, by eliminating repetition and tediousness that occurs regularly.<ul><li>For example, when I am studying chemistry, I open Firefox, Obsidian and OneNote, and open textbooks I have on my computer. This takes valuable time, and reduces my overall efficiency when studying. I plan for my voice assistant to remove this inefficiency, by allowing custom commands, where if I were to say a key phrase, it would do all of these things at once, saving me crucial time.</li><li>In the future, I also plan for the voice assistant to be a general tool in the office, for example it could send emails to large batches of fellow colleagues.</li><li>Furthermore, people who have used voice assistants before may demand high quality in graphical design of the program. Using Tkinter, I plan to provide a well-thought-out visual interface, however <strong>I have used copyrighted images (Siri logo) for parts of the visual design</strong>, as I feel its simplistic design fits my program, and I admire the quality of the Siri voice asssitant.</li></ul></li><li>The program will fill its user&rsquo;s need for a simplistic, easy-to-use voice assistant that will improve their productivity. It will also improve their quality of life, by helping its users achieve a healthy study schedule/routine.</li><li>The licencing used is the Permissive MIT licence, the reasoning for which is explained at the end of the Licencing section</li><li>Having published the project to GitHub, anyone who wishes to modify my code through GitHub will automatically follow the licencing requirements of the MIT licence. Their programs should contain the original copyright notice and a copy of the original MIT licence.</li></ul><p><strong>Licencing</strong>
Currently, there are 3 main software licences used by companies across the world:</p><ul><li><em>Permissive</em><ul><li><strong>Examples:</strong><ul><li>BSD licences (family)</li><li>MIT Licence</li><li>Apache Licence</li><li>ISC Licence</li><li>JSON Licence</li></ul></li><li>Permissive licences are a kind of free-software licence, which means it is allows users to run the program the licence is attached to, analyse the code of the program, and most importantly redistribute modified version of the program under whatever licence fits. This essentially allows developers to configure a program how they see fit, and release their new program under a new licence.</li><li>Permissive licences are also very compatible with other licences, due to its minimal restrictions on the user.</li><li><em>It should be noted that a crucial flaw with Permissive licences is that they do not guarantee the type of licence of derivative software, and thus can result in derivative programs that are not free or publicly available.</em></li><li>There are a few requirements for users of a program under a permissive licence, if they wish to redistribute the software:<ul><li>They must leave in the original copyright notice.</li><li>They must leave the initial licence text of the program, such as the one shown below:</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><div class=highlight title="MIT License text"><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt> 1

However, Copyleft licences are still considered relatively open-source, as like Permissive licences, they grant many user freedoms, such as:<ul><li>Right to perform/display, i.e. the right to use/display the program in public</li><li>Right to modify</li><li>Right to distribute</li></ul></li><li>However, compared to Permissive licences, Copyleft licences do not allow users intending to redistribute modified software to include sublicences.

Where source code is available, some Proprietary and Commercial licences also restrict the distribution of modified source code.</li></ul></li></ul><p><em>Having research many software licences, I have settled on using the MIT licence for my program. I believe this licence reflects my desires for the use of my program, as I hope that others can take the program and improve on it for their own use. I also believe that if their version of my voice assistant is both unique and helpful for others, that its developers should be able to relicense it.</em></p><p><strong>Resources</strong>
The program is Python based, and relies on text files to store data. The program also requires a lot of modules for its basic function:</p><p><em>Modules:</em></p><table><thead><tr><th>Module Name</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Importance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>tkinter</td><td>GUI Design</td><td>Essential</td></tr><tr><td>pyttsx3</td><td>Outputting voice</td><td>Essential</td></tr><tr><td>speech_recognition</td><td>Recognising user input</td><td>Essential</td></tr><tr><td>PIL</td><td>Getting images</td><td>Moderate Importance</td></tr><tr><td>atexit</td><td>Running code when script ends</td><td>Moderate Importance</td></tr><tr><td>fileinput</td><td>Closing text files</td><td>Low Importance</td></tr><tr><td>sys</td><td>Debugging in console</td><td>Low Importance</td></tr><tr><td>time</td><td>Getting time for the user log</td><td>Low Importance</td></tr><tr><td>Open Ai</td><td>Does cool commands for user</td><td>Essential</td></tr></tbody></table><p>There is minimal equipment requirements for the creation and development of this program. I used a relatively high-end Dell XPS-15 and Visual Studio Code for the development of the software. However, I had to install Python 3.10, and also all the modules listed above through PIP installation.</p><p>For Visual Studio Code, I had the <em>Pylance</em> and <em>Python</em> modules installed. <em>Pylance</em> offers <strong>rich type information</strong>, i.e. gave suggestions for minor things for code, e.g. parameters, while the <em>Python</em> module allowed me to run and write the code in Visual Studio Code.</p><p>I also used multiple sources of documentation for the various libraries for the program, such as Python Tutorial&rsquo;s website(
<a href=https://www.pythontutorial.net/tkinter/%29 rel=noopener>https://www.pythontutorial.net/tkinter/)</a>, Tkinter documentation in Python(
<a href=https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html%29 rel=noopener>https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html)</a>, the official documentation of pyttsx3(
<a href=https://pyttsx3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/%29 rel=noopener>https://pyttsx3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)</a>, etc.</p><p>In terms of skills and expertise, I have moderate skills in Python coding. I have a strong understanding of how functions work, which prove incredibly important for managing the structure of the program (having a main function, having a function that takes user voice input, having a function that speaks, etc.). Furthermore, through a strong understanding of lists, dictionaries and the use of text files in Python, I was able to store user data in a text file, and log all user interactions with the program in another file.</p><p>I decided to log the actions of the program, as I felt that this would prove quite helpful as a means of gauging errors in the. However, I did not get to be able to log the change in variables present throughout the program, which means the logs will most likely be unhelpful for fixing logic errors.</p><p>Visual Studio Code was my main source of testing for the program. Through its debugging menu (F5), I initially worked on the raw main.py file. I did so because when I pressed the Run Python File button, it did not access the text files. Later on while working on the project, I realised that I needed to open the folder the program was in, and from then I started using the Run Python File button, as it was easier to use.</p><p>I also used Stack Overflow as a source of advice in using complex/badly-designed modules, such as Tkinter. For example, I initially had a problem with creating a function which would create multiple buttons of the same function, but with different parameters. I had difficulty fixing this issue, as I found that when the program started up, all the buttons were essentially pressed once, and would be unusable after.</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt>1

It also has numerous unique commands, and even includes voice commands that can change settings. I have considered using voice-activated commands to change settings, but I feel there is simply not enough settings to change, and it would be redundant. Furthermore, as the program is a python file, it is generally incompatible with most computers, considering the amount of modules it relies on.</li></ul></li><li><em>Google Assistant</em><ul><li>Google Assistant&rsquo;s greatest quality is its voice recognition software, which is some of the best in the world. However, through Google&rsquo;s text-to-speech module in Python, my voice assistant should have the same recognition capabilities. Stylistically, Google Assistant has a simplistic, colourful design, which I have been inspired by. The design of Google&rsquo;s voice assistant focuses on user interaction, in its friendly voice and extensive utility as a general assistant. I am able to use Google&rsquo;s text-to-speech via its Python module</li></ul></li><li><em>Siri</em><ul><li>Apple&rsquo;s Siri is a very versatile voice assistant. It has limited settings, and is not very compatible compared to other well-known voice assistants. However, in terms of languages available, Siri is quite compatible, supporting up to 21 languages as of April 2021. Siri is mostly designed for mobile uses, which is why it is the most popular voice assistant for mobile devices. Unfortunately, as my program is written primarily in Python, and requires a lot of Python modules, it is incompatible for mobile use. However, I hope to design a voice assistant with much more basic voice commands than Siri, and my idea of customised voice commands give my program an advantage over Siri.</li></ul></li></ul><ol start=2><li>Plan and Design</li></ol><p><strong>Screen Layout</strong>

This is because I cannot leave my own API key in the code, due to the copyright of OpenAI&rsquo;s API, and thus I decided to input it.</li><li>The design of the new 2 windows are very minimalistic, like the original window. I&rsquo;ve chosen to just leave the windows in their standard Tkinter design, while including the logo of the program. I did so as I feel that design is not the main focus of the program, and furthermore due to time constraints I considered it unwise to try and add more stylistic features to the windows.</li></ul><p><strong>Graphics</strong></p><ul><li>The program features <em>very</em> <em>minimalistic</em> graphics. This is because I felt it would be too much of a challenge to use and improve on the basic Tkinter graphics. Furthermore, I feel the simplistic design of the logo makes up for the lack of visual dynamics and contrast in the graphical interface of the program.</li><li>I intended to use minimalistic graphics, as I believe that <strong>the focus of a voice assistant should not be it&rsquo;s aesthetic beauty, but rather its functionality</strong>. In using less engaging graphics, I hope that students will not be distracted by the program, and rather use the program to further improve their focus and productivity.</li></ul><p><strong>User Interface</strong></p><ul><li>The user has 2 ways of interacting with the program:<ul><li>Voice<ul><li>The fundamental utility of the program is that one can use their voice to maximise the functionality of their computer usage. The program clearly indicates when it is listening for audio input, with the text box changing and an audio cue being played.</li><li>This interface is a crucial element of the program, as it fulfils the core purpose of the software.</li></ul></li><li>Peripheral input (mouse)<ul><li>For trivial things like starting the program and choosing an account, I decided to use Tkinter buttons for these things, as I felt they were not worth implementing voice commands, however for future designs of the program this should be implemented.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Algorithms: Flowcharts</strong></p><p><img src=https://eddietheed.github.io/obsidiannotes-v.2//000_Files/Untitled%20Diagram.png width=auto alt></p><p><img src=https://eddietheed.github.io/obsidiannotes-v.2//000_Files/voice%20command%20flowchart%201.png width=auto alt>

I have made a brief survey for my voice assistant consisting of 6 rating questions and 4 written questions, which was sent to my fellow peers in my Computer Science class. The following is a summary of the results, obtained from a sample size of 4.</p><p>Question 1: &ldquo;On a scale from one to ten, how organised are you?&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Average: 5</li><li>Comments: This average is quite shocking, and indicates that the target audience of the survey feel that they are unorganised. This could mean that they would gladly use productivity tools such as my voice assistant.</li></ul><p>Question 2: &ldquo;On a scale from one to ten, how important do you think productivity tools are?&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Average: 8.75</li><li>Comments: This average indicates that the target audience of the survey feel that productivity tools are very important. This could reveal a potential gap in the productivity tool industry, considering the appalling prior results.</li></ul><p>Question 3: On a scale from one to ten, how busy are you, in general?"</p><ul><li>Average: 7.75</li><li>Comments: This indicates that people consider themselves to be relatively busy, which could mean that they would appreciate a productivity tool such as a voice assistant.</li></ul><p>Question 4: &ldquo;On a scale of one to ten, how often do you use a voice assistant?&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Average: 4</li><li>Comments: This could mean that people are generally disinterested in using voice assistants, see them as ineffective, or that there has not yet been a voice assistant created that meets their needs.</li></ul><p>Question 5: &ldquo;On a scale from one to ten, how would you rate my program (any metric)?&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Average: 9</li><li>Comments: From the high average, it&rsquo;s clear that the survey participants liked using my program. This could be due to user bias, or from genuine appreciation of the program&rsquo;s utility.</li></ul><p>Question 6: &ldquo;How would you rate the quality of the program&rsquo;s code?&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Average Stars: 5</li><li>Comments: The survey participants were given a GitHub link to my program, and so were able to read the program&rsquo;s source code. Through either confusion or genuine analysis, the sample group returned a very high rating for the quality of the code, however it would be important to consider bias and the small sample size.</li></ul><p>Question 7: &ldquo;What do you like about the utility of the program?&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Random Answer: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s useful in that it makes certain activities more effecient&rdquo;</li><li>General Sentiment: The program is useful and has a nice aesthetic</li><li>Comments: Despite personally thinking that the program has quite low utility, the survey participants gave quite positive comments. This could be a result of bias.</li></ul><p>Question 8: &ldquo;What do you dislike about the utility of the program?&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Random Answer: &ldquo;It can be slow and not register my voice at times.&rdquo;</li><li>General Sentiment: Voice recognition is hard, the visuals could use some improvement</li><li>Comments: I think overall the comments were quite positive. I can&rsquo;t quite improve voice recognition, as it is currently based of Google&rsquo;s voice recognition, and I probably could&rsquo;ve made it clearer that the design was minimalist in nature.</li></ul><p>Question 9: &ldquo;Do you have any suggestions on improving the program?&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Random Answer: &ldquo;Use a better speech model perhaps?&rdquo;</li><li>General Sentiment: Get assistant to learn voices, more functionality, improve interface</li><li>Comments: These are all good constructive suggestions. If I had more time, I would have certainly worked on these pieces of advice.</li></ul><p>Question 10: &ldquo;Have you experienced any issues using the program? If so, please list them below.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Random Answer: &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t recognise my voice&rdquo;</li><li>General Sentiment: The program is slow, it struggles recognising voice</li><li>Comments: I suspect the slowness comes from the talking pace of the Google text-to-speech voice. This is an easy fix, and I could probably include this in some sort of settings window. As stated before, the voice recognition is out of my hands, and making something better than Google&rsquo;s voice recognition would be quite difficult.</li></ul><p>Here is the link to the survey:
<a href=https://forms.office.com/r/UTPS0bchCd rel=noopener>https://forms.office.com/r/UTPS0bchCd</a></p><p><strong>Personal Evaluation</strong></p><p>Overall, I consider this project to be a success. As someone who has only used raw Python when programming, I felt that having to learn how modules and specifically how GUI modules such as Tkinter work was quite challenging, yet rewarding as I progressed through the task.</p><p>However, the task was quite tiring and due to time constraints, I was unable to maintain clarity and conciseness in the source code. I feel that there is quite a lot of inefficiency and redundancy in my source code, such as creating a function for specific windows, however I found this was the only solution at the time due to issues encountered with Tkinter.</p><p>I think that while the voice assistant is relatively quite functional, in that it can in fact open specific programs and answer intrinsic questions through OpenAI, due to time constraints I was unable to implement custom functions, which was the main goal of the program. However, the inclusion of OpenAI does make up for this lack of features, as OpenAI&rsquo;s API is quite powerful, and can answer very hard questions such as &ldquo;What are 3 important things to remember when studying organic chemistry&rdquo; with responses such as:</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt>1

</span></span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></div><p>This detail in responses from OpenAI makes up for some of the lack of functionality, however I do consider my endeavours in creating a voice assistant with substantial utility not as successful as I had hoped.</p><p>Furthermore, the following are some limitations I&rsquo;ve derived from my program:</p><ul><li>No custom commands</li><li>Account interface is quite redundant</li><li>OpenAI is necessary when it should be voluntary</li><li>Very little amount of actual features</li><li>For some reason the text boxes don&rsquo;t align even though its in their code, this is a trivial issue</li><li>No settings window</li></ul><p>However, there are also some good quality of the program:</p><ul><li>Minimalistic design</li><li>Can open Obsidian</li><li>Can open Firefox</li><li>Can answer questions through OpenAI</li><li>Has an account system</li><li>Saves user data in text file</li></ul><p>In summary, I feel that my project was a great effort in working in the shoes of greater voice assistants which were developed with a lot more funding(and incentive). As a result of time constraints, I fell short of the ultimate goal of a successful, well-designed voice assistant, yet the end product has a lot of potential and could be developed into a very user-friendly, intuitive program.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/obsidiannotes-v.2/Comp-Sci-Class-Notes/ data-ctx="Comp Sci Task 1" data-src=/Comp-Sci-Class-Notes class=internal-link></a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://eddietheed.github.io/obsidiannotes-v.2/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Edward Huynh using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://eddietheed.github.io/obsidiannotes-v.2/>Home</a></li><li><a href=DefinitelyEddie#5369>Discord</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
